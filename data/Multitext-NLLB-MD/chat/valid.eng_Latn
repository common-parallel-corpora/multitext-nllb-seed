Ah that makes a ton of sense, they seem like similar jobs at least in some respects. Encouraging people and helping them meet their goals. You should totally try kayaking! It's super versatile, it can be relaxing on a lake or thrilling doing whitewater
That's right. How  is your family? how many of you are there?
I've always been interested in Kayaking but never really had the opportunity to get in to it. Do you think you could help teach me a bit and maybe we could go on a day of kayaking together?
Yeah that would be so fun! It's really easy honestly, there's a bit of skill with steering but once you get the hang of it it feels super natural.
I baked PB cookies in the shape of my dogs!
That sounds cool. Did your dogs have to pose while you made them haha
Haha. He would not sit still that long. He runs around the kitchen when I bake.
He must be asking for a treat. I bet you cannot resist. I feel bad when I have to say no to pets because I know the food they want is not good for them.
I am sure the smells drive him crazy, but you are right. The food I bake is not good for them. I have dog treats on hand anytime I bake for this reason.
You are one smart cookie. I need to start having them on hand. I usually leave my station and then get them the treats. Have you knitted them anything cute lately?
Not recently. I have been consumed by trying to find recipes. I tend to hobby jump quite a bit. I am sure I will start knitting like crazy once I get tired of baking.
I get what you mean. I wish I had more options of things to do. What else do you think I should get myself involved in?
There are four of us! I have an older brother and my two parents. Us men like to enjoy a cigar together in the evenings.
You like baking and running. So you have eating and exercising down. Have you tried to learn to play an instrument?
I have yet to play an instrument. The closest I got to it was playing the recorder in school haha Did you ever have to play that instrument?
Maybe learning to play would be a great hobby for you since you love music so much! I dabbled with the piano years ago but don't play anymore.
The piano would be a beautiful one to play. I know people that play and I can listen to them play forever.
Today, a wall almost collapsed on me and my crew. The danger is one of the reasons I really don't like the mining field.
Wow, I've never had anything like that happen to me at my bar. Is everyone okay?
People are mostly ok. A few minor injuries but everyone got out in time, no broken bones or, god forbid, deaths. I might try to get out of this line of work soon, these kind of incidents just keep happening
I'm so sorry to hear that, but I'm glad everyone is mostly okay. Have you thought about going back to school? It's tough to work and to go to school, but I hope it will be very rewarding.
Yeah, it's just been so long that I'm not sure it'd work for me. I'll think about it for sure. But I might end up doing a similar job that has less hazards, maybe construction or outdoor work. How's school going for you?
That's a good idea too, I hadn't thought about it but a change of industries might just be right for you. I don't have a lot of free time between my job and schooling, but it's going well, thank you. It's frustrating to not have much time to do the things I would like to do anymore.
I have had some cigars I like, but never got into it. Maybe that has helped me live a long time.
That completely makes sense, it must be pretty stressful. Are you in any clubs, maybe a band or choir?
Oh, I wish, that sounds like a lot of fun. I'm a little shy and only recently moved to town for school, so I'm not involved in any activities at the moment.
That makes sense. It could be a good way to meet new people! Since they'd share at least one of your interests. But I get that time management is super hard on top of a job. How do you like working at the bar? Any crazy customers?
Yeah, definitely! I'll look into clubs around here. Obviously, bar work isn't nearly as stressful as your job, but you do occasionally run into some very rude customers. On the whole, I really can't wait to get stuck into my nursing and get out of the bar.
Makes sense, I was a waiter a long time ago and even though some customers were perfectly polite, it was always the rude interactions that stuck with me
Exactly! You can spend your whole shift with the nicest customers, but one person can ruin your entire workday. I guess you just have to pick yourself up and move on in that scenario.
I just bought a nice Merlot for the weekend.
How does it taste?  What is your favorite kind of wine?
Oh, it's definitely Merlot. A lot of deep tones and richness to it! Do you ever drink wine?
I never drink wine, but I do like beer.
That's definitely true. Though since you've already made it this long, I doubt smoking a few cigars here and there would hurt!
Nothing wrong with a beer now and then, I love having one with my fellow teachers on the weekends lol
Me too, I usually have a beer with dinner.  I like lagers.  Do you have a favorite beer?
I like to try a lot of the local breweries, we have a bunch of them in the area. Very unique flavors and styles, but I lean towards lagers myself
Where are you located? What is your favorite of the breweries?
I live in Detroit, we have a bunch of them popping up to get the city back up and running. There's a small one not too far away with some killer food as well, delicious sliders mmmm
Nice, I live in Denver Colorado, myself.  I have never been to Detroit.
I used to say "You're not missing much" but now I'd recommend it :)
Cool cool, what is your favorite thing going on there now?
I got a new client - the cutest little dog you have ever seen. I think it is has some Chihuahua in it. You should see it trying to keep up with my German shepherd!
What a sight that must be to see! Walk them by my house so I can see them!
Even if it does, I have lived a good life. I just want to enjoy all the time I have left whether that is a week a year or even another decade.
I have a walk at 5pm today. Will you be home then?
I will! Perfect! I can't wait.
How is school going? I hope it has gotten a little better.
Last week was brutal, but this week has been mild. I try to make the most of the good days and not dwell on the bad ones.
That is a very healthy attitude to take on it. Kids can be so cruel. Keep your chin up!
I have gym class next period and I am dreading it. We are playing dodgeball.
I always hated gym class too. I am not athletic at all. I always stood right up front for dodgeball so that I got out asap!
Great tip! Thanks for the trick!
I will see you later. The dogs are sure to cheer you up!
I am looking forward to it. Off to dodgeball :(
I have never heard of the Libby app. I'll have to check that out. I use Kindle because I have Amazon Prime and there are a ton of free books to find that way. The book I read was called Fatal Charm. It was about a husband who murdered two of his wives staging it to look like accidents each time. I hope to find another similar one to read next. What was Billy Straight about?
Does your college have a dorm? Mine just called, I forgot I was even on the waiting list, and I get to move out! Check into it okay?
I just got back from training a client's horse, and they lent it to me for a couple of weeks. Would you like to come over to ride it as well, I'm sure it will be a fun time since you love horses as well.
Yes, I would absolutely love that!
Cool we could do it this weekend if you're free.
Sounds great to me, I'm so excited! What is the horses name?
His name is Bob kind of a weird name for a horse.
Lol, yes but cute! I can't wait to meet him and take lot's of pictures.
You can probably bring your paints and do a painting of the horse. I know I am going to have my camera with me and take some pictures.
Yes, that's a great idea! I'll bring all my painting things with me. Does Saturday work?
Yeah, that sounds great I am free all day.
Awesome! Sounds like a plan then.
Oh wow, that sounds great! I'm envious that you're able to move out. I can't move out. My college has a dorm but I'm not able to move out for now. Do you think you'll be able to concentrate on your studies while living in a dorm?
Indeed I am looking forward to it I know it will be a lot of fun.
Oh yes! I haven't rode a horse in months, I'm very excited!
Is your daughter a professional piano player, or is she in the process of becoming one? What kind of music does your daughter like to play in her concerts?
SHe actually plays a lot of classial music like Beethoven and Bach, it's fun to listen to her just cut loose and do rock too!
That's great, classical music is a good foundation that even rock's greatest need to know!  Does she have a concert coming up?
Not right now, she's off on vacation with her boyfriend in Texas :) Where are you going for your European vacation?
I'm taking it easy this time and letting a cruise ship do the leg work! Were going to the Greek Isles in June. Can't come soon enough.  What do you think about joining me?
That would be awesome, I'd love to see Europe. I got so much vacation time built up the Hospital is practically begging me to take time off lol
The offer is on the table! Its time for YOU to have a vacation, not just your daughter!
Great! I'll have to put in for the time. My daughter gets plenty of time off, time for mom to have some lol
I have always loved to study, so that should not be a problem. I don't like to party, I do want to hang out and maybe have a few video game or movie nights
Exactly! You'll love it. I'll have you traveling all over Europe with me in no time :)  I'll have to find some good places for live music, that way you can send videos to your daughter; she may find it interesting to hear how people play in other countries.  Then again, it may be exactly the same, who knows~!
My daughter would love that, she has always wanted to travel overseas and perform for other countries :)
That sure would be a dream job, talk about loving what you do!!! Although I can truly say I love working in the candy shop, everyone is so happy to be there and I just get to eat free candy all day.
That would be awesome too! I'd be having to exercise a whole lot more, though!
What type of photography is your favorite?
I mostly take simple close-ups of my food. I know its cliche, but I enjoy it.
Do you share those on Instagram or other social media sites?
Yeah. I'll send you a link later. I took this great picture of my jambalaya at a cajun restaurant the other day. It was so colorful (and tasted even better).
Thanks, I would really enjoy seeing those pictures. Do you have a lot of followers that like your photos?
Not really. I take the pictures for myself and don't spend any time promoting them. Maybe one day I'll become a professional and start making money off them
Maybe I can come visit you in your dorm room so I feel more like I'm in college and not living with my parents. Do you think you'll try to form a study group?
That would be an awesome job!! Eating great food and taking photos of it would be my dream job lol
I'd be happy just getting a free meal in exchange for the photo.
I do think some companies actually do that. Might be something to look into in the future.
Good idea. Maybe we could go for a walk some day and I could try my hand at nature photography. I'm too scared to walk in the woods by myself.
I would love to come along. I would bring my new camera!!!!
For sure. I can show you when to use the different settings on the camera.
What are you most excited to do again once you leave Juvenile detention?
I can't wait to sleep in my own bed. I watched channel 13, I need you to send new instructions LOL
I bet! How are the beds there? I could only imagine how uncomfy they might be! I can do that.
It isn't so much the beds as it is the lack of  peace and quiet. ... I get why it's like that, It was my own choices that got me here. So, How are you liking your new home? Do you miss Germany?
Oh yes. I am all about meeting to study together. I have not had one in a year or two, but we used to do like every week a different person would get their parents to buy lunch or dinner, depending on when the meeting was. Like now, I guess that it would have to be one of us haha. But we would have like pizza and pop or burgers and fries. One girl always brought edible arrangement fruit bouquets and those were amazing! We all loved her day. They came with like caramel and yogurt fruit dip! Would you consider joining a group like that?
Yes, I do like my new home I just get a little home sick at times. I defiantly miss Germany.
How long have you been in America?
It's been a little less than a month, so I'm still adjusting but it's been challenging!
I have never been out of the state, much less the country. It must be all new!! Do you like the food here?.... that's the next thing I am excited about leaving juvi for ... good food
Oh yes, the food has been very tasty! The pizza in America is amazing. What is the first thing you want when you get out?
PIZZA!!! ... what kind of toppings do you like?
Mmm, so yummy! I love banana peppers on mine! What's your favorite topping?
all meat is my fav!  with extra pepperoni. Hey,,,, the banana pepper reminded me of the stretchy banana you joked about regarding escaping me from juvi ... Escaping is such a temptation but I keep reminding myself that it is less than a month now
So how is the weather in Nebraska - has it started to warm up yet? It doesn't get so cold down here in the south.
It's not very nice today, just 55 degrees, but this time of year it can change pretty rapidly. The weather forecast says it should be nicer on the weekend, so maybe I'll go out for a walk with my daughter.
Oh yes, that would be great! I'd love to join a group like that. I feel like that would really make me feel like I'm part of a group and not just going to class every day and going back to my parent's hosue.
Nice. I just wish I could go out for a walk at all. Just three more weeks and I'm out.
That's good to hear. Do you have any plans for what to do when you get out? I guess you must miss seeing your friends.
I really want to go out to the movies with my old friends. Some of them never visited or wrote me, though, so I don't know where we stand.
I think you should still contact them. If someone disowns you just for getting in trouble when you're young, they're not a very loyal friend. Lots of people get in trouble when they're young. And if they love films as much as you do, it could be a good way to reconnect with them.
I will get in touch, I'm just afraid they don't want to do anything with me anymore. Even though some of them shoplift just like I did, but didn't get caught.
Don't be scared. In life, sometimes people won't want to be your friend because they judge you, but that's fine, you wouldn't want to be friends with someone who would judge you negatively either. When things go wrong, that's when you find out who your friends really are. The important thing, no matter how old you get, is to use your experiences to improve yourself.
Good advice. How old is your daughter, by the way? Is that the kind of stuff you tell her?
She's 10. As a parent of course you try to give your kids good advice, but mostly they don't take it. As they say, 'a lesson merely heard is never a lesson learned!' Everyone needs to make their own mistakes and learn from them.
I agree, just hope the mistakes aren't too bad. Are you still trying to switch schools for her?
Yes, but it's not that easy because I'm also trying to change my job at the same time, so I have to do lots of things at the same time. I think she could get a better education at a different school but of course it's harder to get your kid into a good school.
We can even have slumber parties to watch a movie after if the dorm allows sleeping over. Idk, I have to find out. But like a once a week slumber party with food and a movie would be amazing! And I have access to HBO Max, so we can watch a newly released movie without having to pay for it like once or twice a month!
Where do you want to go to college?
I would like to go to law school eventually! Did you go to college?
I went to college, but I have dropped out. Maybe I should not have, I don't like my job very much.
Where did you go to college? I'm sorry I misread your question to start .. Doh! I'm open to anywhere so it would be interesting to know how your experience was. How long have you been doing your job?
I was a community college in my town. At the same I got a job at the gas station, and I worked there since then. So it is about 15 years.
Fair enough. That's a long time to be in a job that you don't like - maybe you should try and find something different, something to do with horses? Have you been riding recently?
Yeah, maybe I could learn something about horses, like therapy with horse. I have not been on a horse since September, I miss it very much.
It could be something to do in your spare time - I imagine you get a bit of downtime during night shifts at the gas station? You are welcome to come and see my horses if you'd like, they are missing you :)
I would like to. Can I go in the evenings ? I work from 8h00 AM to 6h00 PM most of the days.
Yes definitely! now it is lighter in the evenings you can have a good couple of hours with them! Do you remember Buttercup? She's so grown up now you probably wouldn't recognise her!
Oh wow!  That's great! That sounds like a ton of fun. Studying turned into fun, who would've thought! I'm sure the dorm room would allow I would think.
I remember her, she was very shy. Do you ride her ?
She isn't shy anymore, she's such a character! Yeah she's the one I ride the most, as she's my first horse. The others I tend to let other people ride :) Shall we arrange something for later this week then? Shall we say Wednesday night? Horse riding on the beach?!
I saw a funny meme on facebook.
What did the meme say? I love funny memes
LOL. That's funny! That's good though, when are you planning on starting up again?
Going to start tomorrow I think. Tonight I have to go to a party so wouldn't be a good time to start today. I am really greatful to facebook though for showing me that message.
Oh nice! Yeah, almost like a sign. What do you do at this program?
They tell you what kinds of foods to eat and have you follow a special menu and there is a weight loss program where you get vigorous exercise, they increase it little by little.  It will get my health back hopefully. Say, when is your heart transplant?
That's nice, I hope you stick to it. It can be really good for your health! My heart transplant is scheduled for next month, I'm very nervous.
It will be okay, try not to worry about it. You are young and have a lot going for you! If you use your psychic abilities I bet you will see that it will all work out!
I hope so! Now I am more excited! We have to decide what subjects we can study together and which ones we will have to like just help out with. Like if you are taking algebra, then I can help, but I am taking a higher math. But if we are both taking BIO, we can study that together!
Ah yes! I've been trying to stay positive about it, thank you! Soon enough we will both be super healthy, lol.
Yes, for sure! We have to have a positive attitude, that's all it takes! Every since my wife left and took the kids I have all this time on my hands so I figure why not do something for the health!?
Exactly! I'm sorry that happened, do you still see your kids?
What's it like to go camping in the woods, do you go with friends or a large group, and do you camp in a designated area?
I go with friends, typically just a small group though. It's a bit easier that way, less people to keep track of and less of a chance people have really different preferences for hiking pace. I love it but the one thing that's annoying is the bugs
That's why I camp on the beach, much less bugs. Have you tried beach camping?>
No I haven't. It does sound nice, I'm just not sure where to do it actually. At the beaches near me, I'd be worried a cop would come and kick me out for staying the night
I just call and get a permit for the night, maybe you can try that? When is the last time you went camping?
Oh that makes sense, I didn't realize that was a thing you could do. The last time was 2 months ago. It was supposed to be a 4-day trip, but there were some pretty heavy rains and we called it after 2 days
That's a bummer. Got any cool trip or hikes planned coming up?
That sounds good, I'm definitely taking BIO right now. It's honestly kind of a waste of time though because it's not my major but pre-requisites suck. I wish they weren't a thing at all. Seems like a waste of money.
I'm hoping to do a longer trip this summer with multiple stops. It'd be a 2-week backpacking trip through the mountains. But it's gonna take a lot of planning. Do you usually camp for one night?
I do, but I am thinking of doing a weekend in this canyon near me. It's not the beach, but it's nto a forest either, should be cool.
Ooh nice, yeah I bet that'll be awesome. The view must be incredible. I'd love to get to go to the grand canyon one day, have you ever been?
I went last summer. I didn't camp, but it was totally worth the trip.
Nice! I'd love to go rafting down it, it'd be so cool to see the walls towering around me
I have just got some more mushrooms out of my garden and am going to put them on a pizza.
Very cool, do you grow anything else in your garden?>
the usual's. like tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, green beans, lettuce, strawberries, blueberries.
Awesome, I wish I could grow things. I have an apartment, but maybe one day when I have my own house.
You should look into doing container gardening if you have a spot that gets sunlight. there are actually quite a few things you can grow indoors too.
Billy Straight is about a runaway kid that goes to hollywood and pretends to be in school but lives in a park. He witnesses a high profile murder and the cops are searching for him, thinking it was like an old bag lady, but confused as to why the possible witness had a presidents book wrapped in plastic out there. I have Amazon Prime as well. The first book I mentioned may be available on Prime reading. The libby app is an app where you can use your local library card to borrow books virtually and read them on your kindle.
Yeah. I am working on getting my childhood education degree concentration in my favorite subject, math. But I have to take English and Bio and Art. I won't be teaching any of that so IDK why they are forcing me to take them. But I like to learn so. Oh well I guess.
I know nothing about this, do you have nay good resources to get me started?
I would suggest finding a local nursery and asking the employees there. they are very knowledgeable and you can even buy everything you need there.
I will look into that, thanks. How is your health?
It's not so great. but that's to be expected. I can at least feel content that I got to live a good life so far. though I do wish to see my grandchildren grow more. even if they are brats sometimes.
I am so sorry to hear that. I think you have a great outlook though. Do you know how much longer you have?
doctors said anywhere from 6 months to 1 year. so I'm just trying to live every day to the fullest right now.
That's all you can do I guess. I wish you all the happiness over your remaining days.
I went for a long walk into town today, went past the music store and looked at the violins there.
Are you thinking about getting a new violin?
Yes, I can't wait, my old one just doesn't cut it anymore!
I know, don't you hate that? But like you said, I like to learn too! Just lots of money.
It's always fun getting a new instrument. Have you been keeping up with your walking?
Yep, been doing really good with that! Sometimes I can get my kids to go with me. And every once in awhile my husband will go.
Very nice, reading any good books lately?
I've been reading Gone with the Wind again, I just love that book!  Say, was going to ask you, do you think you can give my youngest some piano lessons? I want to get him involved in music.
Sure, I'd love to. Piano is a great way to get started with music in my opinion. Have they shown any interest?
Yes, all my kids have had some interest so that's good, my daughter likes the drums and my other son likes guitar. I figure you would be a good teacher to teach them all since you play just about everything! lol!
Yeah, I wold be happy to. Teaching kids music is my passion. I stick to piano but I would be happy to help the other out as well.
Great! Thanks so much! How was the city by the way? Did you visit some homeless shelters?
I sepnt one day exploring and one day volunteering. It was a really great experience. I can't wait to go back, although it will be some time before I have the time.
Which Vampire movie is your favorite?
My pet cow is sick.
I think i'd have to say my favorite is Twilight!
twilight was okay. but there are much better vampire movies. but vampires have nothing on the walking dead!
No, I love the walking dead! Have you been keeping up with it?
I have been. I've even been watching all the spin offs.
Me too! I've been watching a lot of t.v. What have you been up to recently?
mostly just catching up on the walking dead and watching the marvel movies.
Oh nice! Yeah I've been watching lots of t.v, no movies recently though. I've also been working out a lot!
working out is good to counteract the sitting on the couch and watching tv. lol I recently had that surgery so sitting is what's good for me right now.
Exactly, lol. Oh right, how have been after your surgery? I've been praying things went well for you.
It's been going well. pretty normal as far as recovery goes. which is a good thing. no complications.
Oh no! What is wrong?
That's awesome! I'm glad, Hopefully you'll be back to swimming and walking in no time!
My birthday was amazing, I rode my blue motorbike into my own party!
Did you get any cool presents?
Yeah, I was super excited to get money from some friends but my favorite gift was a huge platter that each one of my friends wrote a little message to me. So it's big enough for a pasta meal or huge salad with friends sweet messages written all over the bowl.
That is so cool. That is something you will treasure forever, I am sure. How is your bike racing going?
Yes, I really will try to keep it nice and safe and only hand wash it. I ride all the time and its going pretty good. I sort of twisted my foot but I am just shaking it off as of now. Anything new going on in your world?
Not really, when your 100 you
I bet you are up to date on the daily news though. Do you watch a lot of tv and stay on top of the weather?
I am sorru I did not mean to submit that last one quite yet. I do watch a lot of news, I try to stay balanced and watch from each side. I am outside a lot so I do stay on top of the weather. Supposed to rain the next few days here, how is it out by you?
I understand and can appreciate that you do your best everyday. I still want to your the tips for staying in such great health. The weather here is excellent and great for just about anything outside.
I'm not sure.  But she's not eating very much and is very lethargic.  I think I need to call my dad and see if he can tell me what's going on with her.
My number on tip for staying in good health is get out exercise. Keeping your body moving and soaking up that sweat vitamin D and you can live to be as old as me!
Alright, I am taking to heart that advice! I am going to make sure to soak up the vitamin D every chance I get.
It is so good for you. Even going out on your bike during the day would be good. You get to be on your bike that you love and you get that vitamin D.
I think I am going to apply to university, a friend recommended one that is excellent for architecture.
Oh that's awesome. when are you hoping to start going back to school?
I am thinking in the fall I will start back. I am done doing construction, finally had enough of that!
I can see how construction can become tiring after a while. that's a lot of hard work that goes into building.
Yes, it's hard and your in the heat all day! At least an architect can be indoors where it's nice and cool! I can drink my coffee all day too, lol!
The pay for an architect is quite nice too. I know construction works can make good money after years of moving up. but being inside drinking coffee sounds better
Yes, it sure does! I could go for a cup of mocha right now actually! Ha! I bet you have a coffee in front of you right now!
That is a great idea. If not, are you able to have a vet come to you?
I sure do! gotta have coffee to get through the days with my kids. they have so much energy.
I bet, have you guys taken any family vacations lately?
we went to Disneyland a few months ago. that was a trip that required much coffee. but it was lots of fun. what about you?
I took my family on a mountain bike expedition a few months back. That was a blast! Don't know when the next adventure will be but hopefully before I go off to school!
mountain biking sounds like a lot of fun. but my kids may be a little too young for that still.
I ran into a friend just two hours ago, and I heard they were selling an old rower machine that they no longer use. I think you would be interested in buying it off from them, would you like to get in contact with them?
Oh, that's awesome, thanks! I'm a bit low on money right now, but I'm definitely interested in buying it a bit later. Do you know the price they're asking?
I believe they are askign $100. If you think you can buy it, I bet they would work out some kind of payment play or layaway option.
That sounds extra cheap... I know that they're your friends, but still. Are you sure it's in a working condition?
Yes, I swear by it. They don't really care about making money off it, they just want it out of their house. Let me know if you are interested.
I should be able to do that but I'm worried about what it will cost.  Gosh, this couldn't have come at a worse time.  I'm busy with work and also don't need this extra expense.
Then sure, I am interested, that's basically free considering how expensive rower machines are. Thank you a lot! How are your cats by the way?
They're good. I think one has a stomach bug though, I'm going to have to take her to the vet. How are your dogs?
Oh, you should. I don't like going to vet but my pets' health is worth it for sure. They're great, thanks for asking :) I've started running in the morning and taking them both with me, it's so fun!
I bet they love that. Running outside is so much better, especially if you have fun companions. Have you tried to hike with them?
No, not yet... They don't really like going out, which is weird I guess haha. I'll try to take them with me when we go hiking next time, thanks!
That is strange, lol. Well maybe it's not for them. I wish I could take my cats out, but I think people would give me strange looks.
It doesn't matter what other people think, don't worry! Just take your cats out and see if they like it, in the end it is all that matters.
Recently I talked to my friend, and they told me they were giving away their bunnies they no longer can keep. I was thinking about getting one, but I was wondering if you were interested in owning one as well. I can give them a call letting them know if you're interested.
Heck yeah! I would love to get one or two! Do you know they are boys or girls and what color they are?
they have boys and girls. I'll try to get pictures. I'm not sure about the colors of them right now.
Well I hope your cow gets better! How long have you had your cow?
Okay cool, I am not that picky. Are a, curious if you are going to eat any of yours? I sort of get grossed out at the thought of it?
not these ones. the ones I had before were bred as food. these ones are just pets
OHHH! I didn't know there was a difference, sorry. I hope I didn't offend you because I just didn't know.
it's a good question. I know people think it's weird but it's no different thank raising chickens or cows for food.
That makes sense when you say it that way. I guess people harvest all sorts of animals. I recently tried quail meat, have you tried it?
I haven't had that yet. was it good?
It was very hard to chew and was a bit gamey. I don't think I would try it again unless I had a ton of ketchup!
that doesn't sound pleasant. I think I'll stick to chicken and turkey.
Yeah, I think I might just stop grossing you out! I really do want a bunny though, please!
Where did you meet Taylor Swift, was it at your convenience store?
I've had her for about three years.  She was born on my parents' farm and they gave her to me to keep as a pet.  How close is your robot to being completed?
Exactly, she was buying so many candy bars and she put one in her coat pocket.
Really, like she stole it? That doesn't seem like something she would do!
Well I asked her about it, if she'd steal it and she pretended not to hear me
That's so strange, she must have been having an off day. I know you are a huge fan of hers. What is your favorite Taylor Swift album?
It's probably 1989, how about you? What's yours?
I would say 1989 as well, every song on that album is amazing. I also like Folklore, it's very different from what she has done before.
Yes, they're all great honestly. She's so talented.
Yes, did you see that she is re-recording all of her old albums? Plus, releasing unheard songs from the vault. I am pretty excited to hear all of those.
She's working a lot. That's so cool to be honest. She's great.
Yes I agree. What other artists do you like?
I am still a few weeks out, I had to order a specific part and shipping has been delayed. I am looking forward to seeing how it turns out.
I really like NWA. Do you?
While googling some songs that Barney sings, I found that there are so many and even hour length Barney song compilation videos on Youtube. Amazing!
I like watching videos a lot. I can always watch cartoons and Barney without asking. I want to see it!
I can send the links to your mom so she can make sure they are okay first. but that's pretty cool that you can watch barney whenever you want to.
Okay, she told me I can decide what I watch now. So I can be my own boss now. I also want to watch the movie Pet Cemetery, like my neighbor friend.
I'm just going to take a guess that if you are someone who likes Barney, you probably are not going to like watching pet cemetery. I'll still send the videos to your mom and she can decide if you can watch them.
Well, sometimes my mom is too strict and she doesnt let me watch what my friends watch. I dont think its fair and was thinking about sneaking to watch the pet movie. Since it has the word pet in it I should get to watch it.
I think your mom is just strict because she knows about more things than you do. You should probably listen to her.
I do listen to her. She tells me when dinner is ready and when its pizza I run as fast as I can to the table. I like to listen sometimes.
that's a good start, but it's easy to listen when it's something you want to do anyways.
Oh ok. I have used other type of apps where it syncs up with the library number to check books out. I really love that option when checking out books now. Makes it so easy and convenient!
Is it a male or female robot?  Or does it not have a gender like that?
Ya, it is really easy to listen when she makes me pizza. Its easy to listen when she lets me do what I want to do.
You should try listening when it's something you don't want to do. I bet they teach that on Barney.
I know that Barney always says to clean up your toys and be nice to your friends. I think he wasn't talking about my mom though. I am not sure?
What has been one of the most surprising things you've experienced since coming to America?
I have enjoyed the simple things like going to the grocery store and being able to see all the fresh fruits and vegetables in perfect rows. I also like being able to go to church and be free to take a bible everywhere I go.
It really is the little things, I understand that. You were not able to do those things in Somalia?
I wasn't allowed to go anywhere without my abusive husband. He never went to church and he didn't believe in God or anything like that. He mostly made me clean and stay home to cook.
I am so sorry to hear you went through that. I am glad you are safe now and free to be yourself. Do you have any dreams or goals you are working towards now that you are living in the US?
Thank you, I appreciate your kind words. I would like to study and get some sort of degree. I really like helping others so I need to find a job that is serving others. I am open to ideas.
That is a great quality to have. Maybe you could look into social work or nursing?
Well, it will have either a male or female voice but I haven't decided yet--I am going to include an option that allows you to change the sound of the voice.
Hey, thats what I was thinking about too. I used to help people who would get hurt and I would bandage up the local kids wounds. I want to look into nursing. Do you ever miss your country?
That is a great idea to get into something you are passionate about. I do miss India sometimes, but I have a lot of family and friends who also moved to America, so spending time with them is like being back home.
That is nice and comforting for you. I noticed that when I spend time with my aunt I also feel a sense of home and become less homesick for my country. I don't want to go back there but also get sad and miss it sometimes, it's confusing.
Yes, I know the feeling. Life is so great here, but there are always comforts of home that will be missed. Will any of your family be looking to come over to live or visit?
I think my sister will be visiting me soon and I am really excited about that. We want to visit Disneyland, if we can afford it!
I'm visiting a shelter later today to possibly pick out a cat.
That sounds great! Do you already know which one are you looking for or are you going to decide on the spot?
Well, I am looking for one that is really calm and one that will let me hold it. I am hoping to know the minute I see it. I am open to gettin any kind female or male would work for me.
I remember my dad picking our sheperd, it was so hard. When you see a lot of cute animals and every single one wants to be adopted, it's hard to pick just one.
Yeah, that is a pretty good point. What if end up getting two? I sure hope I can decide on just one. I dont want to trip on an indoor pet so that is my main concern too.
That's a cool idea.  You can change its voice depending on your mood.  Will you view it as a servant or as a friend?  I think it would be cool to have a robot servant.
Don't worry, I'm sure it'll be fine :) Are you going there by yourself or with someone to help you?
I have a home health nurse who drives me places and helps me get around. She is really kind and is patient with me when I am movin slow. I was wondering if your dad still has his dog?
That's good, I'm glad that she will be there to help! He doesn't have him, I have him :) He got it for me as a birthday present. And I'm really grateful for that, best present ever!
Dang, that is a good deal there. I am happy for you! It is nice to have somebody to take care of and to care about. When you hit my age someday, you'll find out a lot of people that you know pass away and it can get lonely.
Well, that's just how life goes I guess, nothing we can do about it. I'm sure you had a lot of fun in your younger years, so there's no use to get sad now :) A cat is a great idea though, it will definitely help with the loneliness!
Oh, boy, you got that right! I was lightening fast and a very hard worker but liked fishing more. I have some fish stories that would knock your socks off.
Haha I sure as hell would like to hear them! A bit later though, gotta run for now, have something to take care of in the garden. I hope you will pick the best cat they have, good luck :)
I searched how many life coaches were in Alaska and found you truly were correct. There weren't many life coaches in your area.
Yeah, there's not much of anything in Alaska! That's why it's easy to meditate :)
How do you find information about meditation ? Do you there is a market for life/meditation coaches in Alaska ?
It will be both, someone for me to talk to if I am lonely but also a servant.
Bookstores mostly...and my brothers in the moastery that have a lifetime of experience. They are a huge help!
Maybe I could get there and work as a meditation coach, most people didn't go in monastery. How much someone in Alaska would pay for a meditation coach ?
To be honest, I'm not sure what the going rate for a life/meditation coach is out here. It's certainly worth a try if it's something you're passionate about.
Yeah, I like meditation and I want to share this technique with others. No matter the pay. What do you do for a living ?
Right now I don't work. I quit my job to go into the monastery a while ago and haven't found the need for a job as I get my basic neccessities taken care of here. So being a cancer survivor...wow! I'm SO happy for you! That's a scary thing to go through.
Yeah, even if the doctors told me it was a small cancer, I could not stop think about it. That is why I did learn about meditation in the first place. What event made you want to study meditation ?
Cancer as well...a close family member was diagnosed in 2006. Thank God she has been in remission for about 14 years now, but the C word is scary, no matter what type or size.
It is something that you can't describe, I would not wish it to my worst enemy.
Absolutely...it was one of the worst times of my life. So what's your favorite marathon that youi've run?
Could you bring some burgers for my videogame party?
I looked up the recipe for earl grey shortbread but I don't understand some of the terms could you explain them to me?
I mean I can, sure, but you still need to pay for them, I'm sure you understand that :)
Lol, yeah, of course. Just wanted you to grab them on the way if it's not too much of a hassle.
No problem at all! How many and which ones?
Grab a pack of 8, not too expensive, lol. I already have burger buns. Thanks again. And bring any games you want to play!
Got it. Oh I can't really think of anything to be honest. How many of your friends are going to be there?
Should be 6 or 5, so even if a few people drop out we'll be good. And have some spare burgers! Ha
Noted :) I actually have a guy working with me, Steven, he'd like to be there too. Is it ok if I'm going to take him with me?
Yeah of course, that would be awesome! Tell him to bring any games he likes too!
Thanks, I will. When are we going to play, can you remind me?
Saturday, 4pm, my place. Feel free to come whenever you want, but not before that! Lol
Sure what terms are you have difficulty with?
Great, we have to work until 4 this Saturday, so we'll join you guys an hour later. Thanks for inviting me again, I think it will be great :)
I won a trip to Disney World through a radio contest!
That is awesome! When are you going?
They're yet to contact me about the trip, but as soon as they tell me I can haha! Wanted to go there for a long time. When did you go there last time?
It will be even more fun since it will be free! I was there last in February. It really is the happiest place on Earth.
Sounds great indeed :) I've also seen a lot of people arguing about Disney World being better than Disneyland, what do you think about that?
I prefer Disney World just because it so much bigger. It has four parks and a lot more rides. What rides are you most excited to go on?
Oh, I've heard a lot from my brother, he went there last year with his kids. They mostly enjoyed The Twilight Zone Tower, Space Mountain and Kali River Rapids. Which ones do you recommend?
Those are all great rides. My favorite is Space Mountain. It never disappoints! I can give you some restaurant suggestions too if you want them?
Cool, I'll be sure to try it then. Sure, that'd be great, tell me please!
It says you have to beat the ingredients. What does that mean?
The Brown Derby and Be Our Guest are fantastic. A little expensive, but worth it. The street carts sell pretzel and ice cream Mickey bars, which you must have!
Haha the names are so weird. Will try it, thank you for all the help, I don't want to miss anything good :)
Have a blast. Take a ton of pictures too!
Have you ever volunteered at an animal shelter?
I have not but I would love to one day. I really do love animals
It is very rewarding. I have donated a lot of time to these poor animals.
Of course, I'm sure it's rewarding. It's great that you spend your spare time doing that. How is your model house coming along by the way?
It is going well. I have put a lot of hours into it. But, feels like it will never be finished.
Yes it sounds like it's a lot of work. Are you enjoying it?
Yes it is my passion honestly. Maybe I bring you by to see how the house is progressing.
mix together. til completely incorporated. Are there any others?
Yes that would be lovely. Would your cats be there? I'd love to meet them as well
Yes of course! Well until be put the carpet in. I would hate for the new home owners to suffer if they happen to be allergic to them.
Oh yes that would be terrible! I'm sure it's a lot of trouble taking care of so many cats, no?
I enjoy them so much and have had them for so long its just part of my normal routine now.
Yes, growing up, there were a lot of stray cats in my neighborhood that annoyed me, so I'm not particularly fond of cats lol
When do you plan to organize your baby shower?
I need to start soon. Are you available to help me, by any chance?
I would be honored! Let's go together this weekend and get started!
Great - thanks! I am thinking something blue and yellow since it is a boy.
Do you want to incorporate animals? Shapes? Disney characters?
That's all that I can remember at the moment. What's the flavor of the shortbread like?
I haven't gotten that far! You are giving me a lot to think about for this weekend.
I have a long run scheduled for Saturday morning, so I will come by afterwards. Probably around noon. Okay?
Perfect. I can have lunch for you. I'm sure you will be hungry after a run.
That's kind, thanks! Yes, I am planning to do 10 miles, so fuel and hydration will be much appreciated.
10 miles! I haven't that far total in my life! You are really amazing.
Thanks for the support! I enjoy it. It keeps me thin and stress free.
I might try to start running after I have the baby. I will need to get rid of this excess weight.
I just watched a great horror movie that you should add to your Halloween lineup!
Very cool! What's the movie's title? If I haven't seen it, I'll add it to the playlist!
It was The Invisible Man, soooo scary! I was afraid to stay home by myself after watching it! When are you going to visit me.  It is always gorgeous here in Maui.
I had a strawberry that I really liked and of course earl grey. Have you read any good books lately?
I still haven't seen it! I'll add it to my list. Haha I'd love to visit as soon as possible! Is the weather really perfect year-round?
Yes it is! We have what's called a rain season but you still get a lot of sun.  The nature here is breathtaking!
Wonderful! I'll have to make the trip over from Oahu! How long have you been there?
About 5 years now. I didn't know you live in Oahu! When did you move there?
I've been here for quite a while! I definitely love it, though Honolulu can get pretty hectic.
I agree, especially the tourist area.  I visited there with my family two years ago. We took my dogs with me.  We hiked to that crater by the ocean.
That sounds lovely! How big is your family?
Me, my husband, two kids and three dogs. How are your dogs doing? What are their names again?
Wow, that's a big family! I'm sure your kids love having three dogs to play with! Mine are named Scott and Scotty!
I have had the best cup of tea, which I  ever tried!
Yeah it does! I am so happy to have someone to talk about books with! Not many people that I know appreciate them as much as they should. Plus everyone always wants to know what cool stunts I have been a part of, they forget that my favorite hobby  is reading everything ever written haha.
I've started reading Caste, as it's very popular at the moment. Have you heard of it?
What kind was it? where did you get it from?
It is at a tea shop downtown, across from the Civic Center. They focus on traditional teas from around the world. Would you like to try it out sometime?
that sounds great! what flavor was it that you had that was the best?
It was a traditional Moroccan tea that had a lot of fruits and leaves that are native to that country. How about this weeked?
I am free this weekend. what time should we meet up?
How about 10? That would give us some time to explore downtown. Do you have any tests to study for this weekend?
I have a test on Friday and then start studying for the next one on Monday. so this weekend is a good time. Should we get any lunch after tea?
That sounds good. Do you know of anywhere good to grab some food?
what kind of food sounds good? It will help narrow down the search.
I like Mexican or Thai. What about you?
I haven't. Is it similar to Hunger Games?
Both are good. but now that you say it pad thai sounds wonderful.
I've just convinced my record deal to let me try writing a rock song!
Wow! congratulations. That is wonderful.
Thank you! I am super nervous, but I've got some good producers to work with. Do you have any races coming up?
I am running the 10K out in Boston next month.  You know I'm a huge fan of rock music.  If you ever need someone to run your songs by.
I will definitely reach out to you. I've got some ideas, but they just need to be fleshed out. Do you think you'll ever do a marathon?
Marathons are not really my jam. lol  I think I will stick to the 10k.  I feel so free when I run.  Almost like I am outside of my own body.
That sounds awesome. I really want to get into running, I think that it would help my mental health. A marathon sounds brutal, you are smart to stick to 10ks.
Well if you would like to train together I'm your guy.  I run every morning from 4:30 to 5:30 down by the lake.
Wow! That's early! How far do you usually run each day?
No, it's about class and race relations in the United States. Definitely a big topic at the moment.
I do a minimum of 6 miles.  When it gets close to a race I do more.  But you can start with just 1 mile.  The important thing is just starting.  I think you would enjoy it.
Do you think I should go get some running shoes?
You for sure need a good pair of supportive running shoes.  And good socks.   You could also get a bucket hat so no one would recognize you when you run.
How many classmates do you have?
I have 7 mates in my class we all like to play as a group.
Yeah what sort of games do you like to play together?
If we have a ball we like to play football on the yard if not we play games like tag.
Yeah I have never really played football but it looks like fun, I don't get out much unfortunatley.
You should get out and play it some time it is a fun sport to play. How is twitch streaming going?
It is going really well I have thousands of followers who watch me.
Only because people make it a big topic. race relations will always be a big topic because it generates lots of money.
Yeah and how is the robot building going?
Not to bad getting there slowly but still have plenty of work to do until it will all be ready. Not your sort of thing though as your not into games.
No I played a couple before but I just can't get into them, I would rather be outside playing with my friends.
Yeah I don't blame you I wish I could get out more but this water allergy stops me doing it.
That must be a real pain in the neck having to miss out on things.
I just had the best tacos ever! Have you ever had fish tacos before?
I love them! Where did you have it?
I got them at a Hawaiian food stand. They used fresh fish they had flown in from the islands. They were really good! You should try them out.
You'll have to send me the address. Maybe we should meet up this weekend?
That sounds like fun! I'd love to go back there. Maybe we could hit up some of the shops near there.
In my part of the country, it is unfortunately not so evolved. Where are you from, by the way?
That sounds good. I get off work at 2 PM. Any chance that would work for you?
Yes, that works for me. Have you listened to any good albums lately?
Nothing recently. But I did find this guy on youtube who does accordian covers of metals songs. It's um.... interesting.
Ha! Sounds like Weird Al. I'll have to check it out, you should send me the link. How do you like your Pathfinder? I was in the market for a new car.
It's dependable. Nothing special, but it's lasted me years and that's what counts for me. What's your budget?
I was thinking around $15-20k. Would that get me a fairly decent one?
They hold their value pretty well, but I know you could find a used one with plenty of life left for that much!
I just had a swim session. Do you have any tips on the breaststroke?
I can say I do really. I'm not a pro. I feel like I should be asking you! How goes the coaching?
It's going pretty good.  I moved here to coach at a university.
Are you saying race relations is worse now than say 20 years ago or has it improved? and what about 20 years before that? I imagine you would say it has improved, but we talk about it more? why do you think that is?
That's cool. So, your coaching is on the competitive end of things?
Yes, we compete in NCAA athletics. I coach in Florida.
Nice. That sounds exciting. Is there a season of sorts or does it go year round?
There is a swim season, but for me I swim all year round. I also enjoy surfing.
Surfing looks wonderful, but it could be to exhausting for me. As much as I like to swim I need to keep my heart rate reasonable.
That's understandable, maybe I could coach you on some techniques to lower swimming exertion.
That would be great. Its one of those things you don't think about getting help with but it makes sense that it would help.
Yes. Have you been doing anything else interesting lately?
Just some work around the animal shelter. Nothing outside the norm. Thinking about teaching some kids to code html, just not sure how to go about getting it started.
Have you had any luck with your blind dates?
I learned how to play a Rascal Flats song on my guitar.
Unfortunately, no. Most of them haven't really progressed after the first date
What seems to be the biggest issue with these dates not going anywhere?
Considering what happened to my parents, I didn't really grow up under a healthy marriage, so I'm not sure I entirely know how to care deeply for someone
Oh, I understand. Have you sought out any therapy to help you?
I have tried before, but it all happened so long ago, I don't really want to bring it up with anyone. I usually just like to go out for walks in nearby parks when I'm feeling overwhelmed
I can totally understand that. Maybe we can go on a double blind date sometime soon?
Yes, I'd like that. Maybe you can play some songs and impress both our dates haha
LOL I can try! Where do you normally go on these blind dates?
We usually go to local musical festivals. I just figured if they enjoy it, then at least we'll have something in common
That's not a bad idea honestly. Plus there is plenty of people around since these are blind dates and you don't know much about them prior to these dates.
That's so awesome!  Which one is it?
Exactly, maybe for our date. We can head to a Rascall Flatts concert
I recently found a new job I may apply for. It would give me more freedom than my current one.
That's great! What's the job?
It's at a local theatre.  I'll be doing backstage management.
What is that work like?
It's a lot less stressful than being a veterinarian.  I will basically be running props, sets and how the players leave and enter the performing area.
What sorts of plays does the theatre put on? Do you ever have stirring renditions of Shakespeare plays?
Mostly, the place does Indie work.   The guy who runs the place also plays role playing games, so he like organically crafted stories.
I would be interested to see a play where the scenes are selected by a role of the dice.
That would make for an interesting show, for sure.  It would rely on a lot of improv.   I'll bring it up the next time we have an RPG night.
Life is a highway, it is such a great song, I had to learn it! Have you listened to any Rascal Flats songs lately?
Yes, certainly it would be. Congratulations, it sounds like it will be a lot of fun as a job.  Certainly less stressful than medical care.
You should check it out.   Their ticket taker just moved to Oregon, so there's an open job available.
I'll look into it, I'd prefer it to cleaning houses.  What are the hours like?
My agent told me I can move to my new home asap.
That's great news!  I'm really excited for ya.
Thanks so much! I'm really excited to have more room for everyone. How are you liking the new house?
Well, I just moved in, with my boyfriend, Tim.  I like it.  It all feels so new.
Did you guys get a new construction or previously owned?
Previously owned.  The core of the place was built in the 20's but then updated in the 50's.  The last restoration was like 86 or 87.
Wow so the home is almost 100 years old, that's pretty cool! Do you see yourself doing any reno soon?
I haven't been listening to them lately, but I'd love to hear you play some.  Do you learn by reading sheet music or tabs, or can you play by ear?
Some, but not a lot.  One room has those little glass wall tiles.  It reminds me of a lounge at a Holiday Inn.  So that room is going to get redone.   Other than that, the place is great.   We grilled burgers out back, lastnight.
Sounds good. Do you add lot of variety to your burgers or do you like them plain and simple?
I hate to say this, but I'm fickle.  Sometimes, I pretty much put a salad on top of the patty.  Sometimes, just plain ketchup.  It just depends.
Nothing wrong with that. I can never eat the same thing twice in two weeks so I guess I beat you in that category lol
I feel ya.  With having so many sets of twins, you pretty much need some variety.
Brad Pitt is filming a new movie and I have been hired to be his stunt double! I am so thrilled.
That's absolutely incredible! Congratulations! I'll bet that was a nerve wracking audition
Yes, I had to jump through a stack of three window panes to get the job.
Oh WOW. Can't say I've ever had a job interview quite like that! Did everything go according to plan?
Yup, no injuries. I did it on a motorcycle, they were in three individual hoops.
