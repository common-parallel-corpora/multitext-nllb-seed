We got up a five a.m. and took a 3 mile jaunt all around our neighborhood. It was great exercise and a great way to start the day! How did your day start today?
You're shaming us mortals with that routine!  I rolled out of bed, grabbed a cup of coffee, and watched the goats frolic while the sun came up.  Are you working today?
That sounds like a lot of fun! It is probably too late to jump in, but maybe I can come and watch? When and where will it be at?
Nope I've got the day off! I got up super early, but I have to admit that I will probably take a nap. Tell me more about these goats!
I just had a rehearsal with my band. If you ever want to hear me play, let me know and I'll get you into one of our shows.
It would be awesome to go to one of your shows! Do you have anything coming up?
I have a show 2 weeks from now. I can leave tickets at the door for you if you have time to come by. I know you are very busy since you are going back to school.
Okay, cool! How long do your band's shows usually last?  I just want to stay organized and plan out my schedule around it.
Our set is usually an hour long. I get it can be hard to stay organized. I am in school also, so I really have to keep my time managed. Are you happy to be going back to school?.
Nice, one hour seems like the perfect length.  I've been very happy with the decision to return.  I think it'll really open up some new job opportunities with more management responsibilities.  I feel like finance is so impersonal and isolated nowadays and I love the idea of managing people.
That sounds amazing! Will you be returning to Yale, or do you have another school in mind?
Probably not Yale, I'd like to stay closer to home this time, especially since I want to try and continue working while I attend.
That makes a lot of sense. You will save so much money by staying close to home and continuing to work, especially since you just brought a new car. How do you like the new car?
You can see me play at the Boston diamond right in the city if Boston. It will be at 3pm eastern time.  Maybe you can bring Barnaby too?
The new car has been wonderful! It's got such a smooth but powerful ride!  Have you ever driven a BMW?  If not, you need to experience it sometime.  They've got a heavenly road feel.
I am sure. I have not had the chance to drive one. I can't wait to buy my first car as traveling is at the top of my list of things to do. I would love nothing more than to take a cross country road trip and than expand internationally. I have to put all these languages I am learning to good use you know.
An international trip would be a great way to use your language skills.  Maybe you can start in Germany, rent a BMW, and drive through France into Spain?  I'd love to travel like that sometime in the future when I've got more spare time.
Have you played any other video games recently?
I have been.  Just the other day I started playing "Kingdom Come: Deliverance."  Have you heard of it?
I haven't! I'm still obsessed with Call of Duty. Maybe that one could be my next video game.
It's a little bit like Skyrim if it were set in the actual Middle Ages and no magic.  Since you like Fallout, I think you will like it.  I wish I was better at COD, but I just die so fast!
Haha that used to be me in COD, until I started playing daily and getting good. I'll give that game a try! Is gaming one of your favourite things to do?
I don't always have time, but I do enjoy it when I can.  I guess I'm just so focused on my boyfriend.  Do you have a significant other and is it serious?
I guess you're a teacher too, so not a lot of time off. Yes! My husband and I are about to celebrate our one year anniversary! Going to New York. When are you planning on getting married?
Oh, I would never go on a road trip that far off without him. That is my baby haha. What day is it? I have some vacation time and I am really wanting a change of scenery!
Congratulations!  I bet you will have so much fun!  We are going to get married in July, but it's going to be a small event. We wanted to make sure we could still enjoy our vacation, but not take off any work.
Wow that's coming up fast, how exciting! Summer weddings are my favourite since they're so pretty. How did you meet your boyfriend?
There was a festival downtown a couple years ago.  He saw my car and asked me about it.  Then we spent the rest of the time together.  We really hit it off. How about your husband?
How romantic!! That's a good first meeting story. My husband and I met at the dog park. Our golden labs used to play together and I always thought he was cute. He eventually asked me for my number and we hit it off!
Awwww.  That is a beautiful story. We could write a book "Dogs and Cars: How we met our husbands!"  Is your husband into roleplaying like you are?
What is the last watch you bought?
a vintage Bulova Valjoux 23. That is an old model of watch from a famous maker. It's not made any more. What a beauty! I was really luck to get it. How's third grade treating you this week?
That sounds like an expensive watch? How much was it? School is OK. Recess is my favorite part!
It wasn't too bad, about $750, and in moderately good condition. What do you play at recess? I hope kids still like to play outside and not just be on screens. I had so much fun at recess when I was in 3rd grade.
That is a lot of money! I only get $25 a week for allowance from my parents. We do play outside on the playground and on the blacktop. I like going on the swings and playing kickball and basketball.
It will be on May 8th 2021. I hope you  can make it out. I will have a bone for Barnaby too!
I liked kickball A LOT at your age. Wow, $25 a week!!!!!!!!! I only got $1/week at that age. Wow. What do you do with your allowance, generally!
Only a dollar? I could only buy one candy bar with that. My parents make me save $10 of it, and I buy snacks and drinks from the school vending machine with the rest.
If you don't mind advice, I'd save more of it. Either long term for important things like college, or even for toys or video games or whatever -- soda and snacks are a waste.
Is buying soda and snacks really a waste? I like them, though. Maybe I'll save money for when we go to Disney World this summer. I can't wait to meet Mickey and Minnie Mouse!
Wow, Disney world! You'll have so much fun!
I hope so! Have you ever been there?
No, I've never had a chance. What rides to you want to go on?
What brand of coffee do you drink?
Nothing special, usually the cheaper stuff at the supermarket. I do appreciate the better coffee products, but I'd rather not spend the cash
That's reasonable. Maybe have one in a good coffee shop when you're travelling, I'll be travelling to Paris soon, how was your experience with Louvre?
That is so perfect! I can put in my leave for may 4th and head out that evening! I prefer to drive at night when I am not working. I can be there by friday night! Is there a local hotel that lets dogs stay that I can set up a night at?
Lot's of good coffee in that City. I was mostly awed by the building, itself. What a space to be in!. It was great to see many of the old Masters, but I especially liked the Egypt collection. What are you going to Paris for?
Wow! I'm super excited! I'm going there for a school trip. What better way to learn but to go and see it myself! My trip to Spain was awesome, but Paris has a different vibe that I want to experience. Are you not busy with school? I'm surprise you get to travel a lot.
Yes school is very consuming, but only another 8 months to get working. I haven't really travelled alot. I went to Europe once with a friend and that's about it. The dog keeps me from straying too far
I know how that feels! That's not too far from graduation. My lab pit bull is very clingy. What kind of dog do you have?
I have a beagle, about 3 years. She is lots of fun and so well behaved. Are you still living with two dogs in the house?
One of my twins hit his first homer today - not bad for a 5 year old! I was so proud.
That's exciting! Does the other twin play baseball as well?
The other twin likes watching the other because they are really inseparable. They have a really strong bond. So, his sport is caring.
That's really cute to hear! One of my grandsons plays baseball as well.
What is your grandsons baseball team name?
Nice.  I try to, but I've been working on the two Mustangs.  One is a 68 and the other is a 66 Hertz clone.
Yeah funny you ask about that. We have so so many dog lovers in the city of Boston that there is a chain of hotels that allow you to book a room for you pet too! Isn't that just wild?
He plays for a team called the Wildcats. How did you get in to coaching?
The previous coach was the father of another player and my best friend. I now am in charge of the team to help bring things into a natural calmness like before when he was here. Things seems to be going well.
I'm glad things seem to be going well. What is your baseball team's name?
Our baseball team name is Pirates. The children like the idea of doing what they want so as a team we decided that the name will be of people with the most freedom and that happened to be a pirate.
That's an interesting philosophy for the naming of a team. Do you plan on having any more children?
I don't plan on having any more children. I wanna focus on the kids I have right now.
That's a noble sentiment. I have my hands full with my grandchildren regularly.
Have you always been a fan of New Kids On the Block?
Yes I have! I've listened to NKOTB since the early 1990s. I love their songs "Hangin' Tough" and "Step by Step". Do you like New Kids on the Block?
They are ok, I would rather listen to underground rap. Do you like it?
Actually, that is really amaze balls. I cannot believe that it would be so easy. If there is one with a pool that allows dogs, I would love their info. He loves to swim with me, and I have not been able to find a local hotel to swim at with him so we always have to go to the river but the currents make me kind of uneasy.
I do like rap, but I don't know much about underground rap. In my dance class, we do a routine set to "Bad and Boujee" by Migos. Which underground rappers do you listen to?
I like J Dilla. I've been listening to him for awhile now. I just had chilli cheese fries. They are awesome.
I'll give J Dilla a listen on YouTube later. Chili cheese fries sound yummy. My favorite type of French fries are disco fries with mozzarella cheese and gravy.
Wow, fries with gravy are really popular around here too. I thought it was just a local thing. Do you make them yourself or do you get them from a restaurant?
I like to get them from the local diner. My dance class goes there every Friday evening after class.
That sounds fun. I like cereal also. How often do you eat it?
I eat Raisin Bran and a banana every morning. Sometimes, I have cereal as a late-night snack, too. What's your favorite cereal?
My favorite is Honeycombs. I have them a couple times a week. So do you still play with your lite brite?
I haven't played with my Lite Brite since I was about 10. It's still up in my attic gathering dust. I have good memories of it, though.
I might be going to Colorado for a gymnastics tournament!
Yeah they do actually have a play area for you and your dog, including a pool. That cost extra though. Just google Paws and Friends hotel in Boston  and you will find there contact info on there website.
I still am so impressed that you won a gold medal. We should get together soon and meet up at a great Italian restaurant. Would you like to do that?
I'd love to!  That sounds wonderful!  Know of anywhere I can get some good garlic bread?  I think that's my favorite part of any Italian restaurant!
Well when you get to Colorado we can meet. I just need to get a sate you will be here. Since yo may be coming to Colorado I can drive pretty much anywhere in the state to meet you consideing you will have travelled a ways to get to Colorado. I know of a bunch of great places that have delicious garlic bread. I live near Aspen. Do you know if you will be flying into Aspen or Denver?
I was thinking Denver but I could probably fly into Aspen if it's easier.  I don't want you to have to drive too far!  Denver just seemed to have more flights and be a bigger airport but I think that they were the same price!  I'm not sure when it will be.  I'm hoping next month.  How's the weather in Colorado in May?
Yeah Denver is HUGE! It is also very beautiful. The weather is really warm in May- not too hot- not too cold. We can also go hiking if you want- I rock climb in a place not too far from Denver. I may not be much of a gymnast but i can climb a rock like a pro.
I've gotten a bit out of shape since my Olympic days but I think I could still handle a good hike!  It would probably be good for me to get some high intensity exercise in!  I've been a bit lazy lately and after all that garlic bread and alfredo sauce I'm going to need to do something to burn off some calories!!  What's the highest mountain you've hiked?
Oh- I thought you were coming to Colorado for a gymnastics tournament. Are you a participant of a coach now? When you were in the Olympics what was you strong point? I mean did you do floor routine- bars or horse. I think it is called horse-lol- but I know so little about gymnastics so I may be wrong.
Floor was always my strong event.  I loved to tumble!  I'm a coach now!  I just tell other people to do the hard work and I stand back and watch!  Which is how I've gotten a little out of shape!  People call the vault a variety of things - horse is one of them!  I've competed on beam and bars too but floor will always have my heart!
Haha- yeah I guess with your love of Italian food you probably are better off coaching. And as far as you previous question about the highest mountain I have hikes- I really do not climb high mountains as I rock climb but I have hiked to the top of  Crestone Peak Mountain in Colorado. It took a lot out of me and like you, I am not in as good a shape as I used to be.
I bet the view was amazing though!  Do you ever get altitude sickness?  I always hear about that with people who climb up to high points in Colorado!
I don't mind the extra cost. It isn't like I have actual kids to take care of haha. All my extra money and time goes into my buddy. He even helps when I volunteer at the pet shelter! Good times. Ok, What is the weather like that way? I will need to pack accordingly.
The view was amazing! No I never get altitude sickness- knock on wood- I think because I took so freaking long getting to the top that my body acclimated to the higher altitude. So let me know when you will be coming so I can make plans on meeting up with you. I can hardly wait to see you!
Do you ever enter road races with your bike?
I have not. I thought about it but I would need more practice for that. I hear sometimes people race in New York City. I imagine that would be hard with the crowds.
I have hear they do some racing here but I have not seen it personally. What type of biking do you do then?
I mostly do leisurely biking. I wanted to get the best bike I could since I dont have a car and that would be my only was of getting around, but I love just taking rides for fun.
That sounds like a great pastimte. I would like to try that, but riding for pleasure does not make a lot of sense to me inside the city. Are there very scenic places that you ride?
That is very true. I like to ride in the state park. There are so many bike routes you can take. Since I attend school virtually I have more free time since I don't have to travel.
I start business school next year, maybe I can take a nice trip before I start and visit some state parks and enjoy something different for awhile.
We can definitely do that. Are you excited about starting school?
I am excited, but also a bit nervous. There is a lot to live up to with my dad already being a bank president and all. Business school will take a lot of focus and hard work to be sucessfull.
The weather changes a lot here in Boston. They say even the weather experts can't  predict more than three days ahead. So I am not going to pretend that I know anything more than what the 5 day forecast says for Boston today!
That sounds like a lot of pressure. I am confident you can do it. Do you want to follow in your dads footsteps and have a similar career?
I am not sure which type of business I want to end up in yet, but I want one that I can be succesfull enough to finally end up in a penthouse with a great view of the city!
Wow, that is a great goal. I live in an apartment, by myself, but I enjoy the peace that comes with it.  I am not much of a fan of crowds so city life wouldn't be suited for me. I guess you like crowds.
How has the language studying been going?
It has been going great. I love learning new languages. When I am not learning language's I study music.
Dang, you've really got a knack for that type of stuff don't you?  I'm the exact opposite, I don't think I'll ever learn a language... But I can fix your car, haha
I wish I could fix my own car. Mechanic skills come in handy when you own one. My Mazda Protege tends to be at the shop a lot. Do you work on your Mustang often?
I work on it every weekend! You're welcome to come over sometime and I can teach you some of the basics.  Not everything will look the same as your Mazda, but it'll be similar enough that you can start getting your feet under you.
That would be great!  Do your dogs bite? I am not usually a fan of animals.
They'll only bite if the don't like you!  Haha, I'm kidding, but I can keep them in the backyard while we work if you don't want to interact with them.  Were you ever afraid of your black lab back when he was around?
I understand. Ok. I will just come prepared for anything! I will only be there for like 4 days anyway, so I guess it won't really matter too much.
Not him specifically. Other dogs do scare me. You never know how they are being trained. Peoples beliefs can translate to how they groom their pets to be.
Yeah, that's very true.  Some people don't treat their pets with any respect, so it's not surprising when they lash out.  I promise my dogs are well-trained, but I can still keep them away just in case.
That sounds good. Thank you for understanding. What is it like to be a Pagen?
It's very freeing, I like not being tied down by what others expect of me.  I'm still spiritual, but I don't feel obliged to act ritualistically.
That makes a lot of sense. I feel the same about practicing the Left Hand Path. There is nothing more freeing than following your own path and not the ones others try to pave for you.
I am searching for a new car since my old was in an accident, and think I found a new one - a gray SUV.
Have you been able to test drive it yet?
Yes, it has a lot of different features.  Cruise control, heated seats, lane assist to name a few.  I think I am going to get it. Have you played any Call of Duty?
That sounds nice! I hope it works out so you can get it. Yes, I have been playing Call of Duty a few times a week, but I have been too tired from work to play too much.
Oh, are a lot of people looking for health insurance?
Today's weather was beautiful for biking.  It was the first thing I did after my long day working my construction job.  Did you get to play any guitar or piano today?  Or perhaps a drink at a local bar?
There are, but I have received an uptick in calls from people with questions about their health insurance. How is work going for you?
Understanding all the policy changes can be confusing. I have been delivering a great deal of packages, so I am getting my exercise.  I like being busy, makes the day go faster.
I agree! Do you have a walking route or driving route?
I have a driving route but I get plenty of walking in going back and forth to the doors for the packages.  Have you heard any good music lately?
I've heard a couple new songs on Spotify, I like to have a mix going throughout my day. What about you?
I also have a playlist on Spotify..  I love listening while on my routes.  It keeps me energetic and upbeat. I listen to gospel music.  What type of music do you like?
I listen to a lot of indie music but sometimes I like more upbeat music to really get me energized.
What type of music do you like listening to?
I like Tool the band that is my favorite by far. I consider them to be a genre all on their own kind of hard to put them into a category.
Ah cool. Yeah it's always hard for me to classify the genre of artists. If it isn't clearly pop or rap I usually just call it "alternative" haha. So do you play any instruments?
I did fiddle around with my guitar a little.  I played some Bob Dylan after I ate.
No sadly I don't play any, I had fiddled around playing an electric guitar for a few months but I never stayed interested enough in it to keep at it. How about you? Do you play any instruments?
Ah, so do you mostly study music theory in school? Or do you sing? I don't play anything, I learned piano for a few years when I was a kid but was terrible at it haha
I don't sing or play any music at all, just like you. You're related to Christopher Columbus? That's actually really cool how did you find that out? I've never had a genealogy report before.
I found out from my parents, I never got a formal report but stories got carried down the generations. It'd be cool to do one of those though, see if there are any other mystery relatives I have
Yeah, that's something you should get done. I want to get one done too, it could be very exciting finding out your ancestor was someone very famous who changed the world. It could turn out though to be pretty boring. That's probably what would happen for me, I'd be related to nobodies. You mentioned you liked making Paella what is that?
Haha well you never know! Paella is a spanish dish, mainly in Valencia. It has rice and usually seafood. I fell in love with it when I went to Spain and decided to learn how to make it. Do you cook much?
No I don't do much cooking, I am a TV dinner kind of guy. It's too easy for me to pop something in the oven and come back 40 minutes later and chow down so I don't do much cooking. Do you like cooking things other than paella?
That makes sense, I'm definitely like that with some things where it's just easier to get it done with. I go through phases where I get obsessed with cooking certain things, so right now it's mainly paella, but recently I was trying out different pizza doughs
I didn't even know there was different kind of pizza doughs, can you explain some of the different types? I am curious now.
My cat did the funniest thing yesterday! She ran into the wall playing with a laser.
Nice. Is Dylan a favorite of yours? I haven't been much into music in a long time but sometimes I wish I listened to more.
Awe!  I hope she was okay!  Sometimes I miss having a pet!  I'm not sure I could handle taking care of 5 of them though!  I don't know how you do it!
It sure is hard work! What kind of pet did you have before?
I had a dog.  I've never had a cat before.  Have you ever had a dog?
Aw what was his/her name? No i've never had a dog before!
Her name was Zoey.  What makes you like cats so much?
That's a lovely name! I like that they are independent, means i can spend all day at the construction yard if i have to. What did you do before retiring?
I was a tailor.   I worked for a bridal shop altering dresses for weddings.  You should see some of the amazing dresses I've seen!  Now I just spend my days at the casino!  That's why I haven't gotten another dog!  My tailor job was so flexible I could work when I wanted to as long as I got the dresses done in time so I'd always be home to feed and let Zoey out!
Oh yes that's right. I'd love to see some of the dresses i bet they were amazing! Have you considered getting a cat? You could still go to the casino and he/she would be fine on their own for a bit?
I thought about it.  I've just never had a cat so I don't know much about taking care of them.  I've heard they scratch up furniture.  Is that true?
Well yes i suppose they do but they can be taught not to as they get older, lots of people keep them outside in catteries, that could be an option. At least you could grill without worrying about a cat burglar nicking your sausages.
Yes, I've always loved Dylan.  I think he's such a musical genius. He's not the only reason I want to get into music, but he's one of them.
That is true!  Although Zoey was so small she couldn't get up to the grill!  I'm partial to tiny dogs!  What is a cattery?
Have you taken any good hikes lately?
Yes! My boyfriend and I went on one last weekend and we have a hike planned for this weekend!
Where did you go and and are you going to the same place again this weekend?
We went to this place called turning point near us, it was beautiful! Our hike for this weekend is planned for a place about an hour from us. Have you been on any hikes recently?
I was planning one for this weekend at a local state park.  It has some waterfalls that suppose to be amazing.  I am excited to go and spend some time on me.  A late birthday present for myself.
That sounds so beautiful and relaxing. Yes you deserve it! How was your birthday, happy belated by the way!
Thank you.  It was good.  I got to spend some time with family and a few friends that I have not seen in awhile.  We went to a great burger place.  It was awesome.  The hamburger had a fried egg on it.  Have you ever had one with egg?
Oh wow that sounds unreal. No I haven't but now i'm gonna have to get one this weekend! I'm glad you had a good birthday though.
Yes, you should.  I was unsure at first but when I bit into it, it was really good.  What other plans do you have for this weekend?
What are doing with those two?
Since you're so interested in music, do you ever get out to see local bands? I used to go to concerts every few months when I was younger.
Yummy! We're planning on getting a nice bite to eat after our hike so I'm defiantly suggesting a place that has a burger like that! Other than that no other plans. How about yourself?
Just want to relax and enjoy the beauty of outdoors. We both sound like we have great weekends planned.  We should get together one weekend and do a hike.
Absolutely, I would love that! Do you know if you are free for next weekend?
How is your cat doing?
My cat loves cuddling and sleeping in my lap. She is so chill.
Is she sleeping in your lap right now? What is her name?
Yes, she is. Her name is Brandy. I named her after the Looking Glass song.
Oh, I love that song! Have you gone for a run today?
I ran this morning around the neighborhood. I like feeling the cold misty air on my sweaty face when I run.
I know right!? I enjoy running early in the morning as well. How far do you usually run?
Yes, I try to stay connected to the local music scene, and also try to see bigger acts when they come to town, although money and time are always consideration too.  What was the last concert you went to?
I usually run until I can feel the sweat run down my back or I just miss my cat and wanna play with her again.
Hm, for me that would not be very far, but I sweat a lot. How old is your cat?
My cat is sweet 16. She is so pretty with her gray hairs.
Wow! She has been around for a long time. Have you had her for her whole life?
She has been around since I was young but not my whole life. But I have been around for her whole life though. I hope I can be a great parent for her.
I just had a nice ride with coco.
That's great.  Where did you ride?
Just along the river by my house, I had my headphones on to listen to some music. Very relaxing.
It sounds like it.  I rode Charlie earlier.  We went up to a clearing next to my neighbors and watched the children playing.  I also had my headphones on during the ride listening to country music.  Heard a great song by Faith Hill.  What kind of music do you enjoy?
I love country music! Faith hill is a staple on my playlist! Charlie must be a good sized pony for you to be able to ride him? Have any pizza today?
Yeah, it's definitely hard to find time nowadays. I think the last concert I went to see might have been a pair of cellists with some friends. I think they were called 2Cellos but I could be mistaken.
He is a Welsh pony so yes fairly large.  No, no pizza.  But now I want some.  What is your favorite Faith Hill song?
Pineapple or no? It has to be Wild One for me, a classic!
Pineapple only if in the mood and only with ham.  My favorite song is It's your Love with TIm McGraw.  Their relationship is an inspiration to me.
I agree! 24 years togr
Do you have a significant other?
Yes, 6 years. Hopefully one day we are together as long as Faith and Tim. What about you?
Just celebrated 20 years.  Its a beautiful and scary journey at the same time. Growing together while still maintaining our individual selves.
Having motorcycle is cool What kind do you have?
only ever had harly davidson bikes
Nice! I've always wanted to ride one. Have you been using it a lot?
Oh, nice.  Have you heard of Mark O'Connor?  I once saw him in concert with Yo-Yo Ma.  That was amazing.
living in florida it can be driven nearly daily never having to be put away for winter
That's good, are you able to drive it to your job as a waitress?
oh yes, i wear pants for work and love taking the bike to get there
Amazing, you must look cool driving up on your bike! Interestingly enough I recently wrote a new song about motorcycles!
that sound great, i would love to hear that! i love any song having to do with riding a motorcycle
Yeah! It's hard to incorporate piano into a song about motorcycles though LOL! Would you ever learn to play an instrument?
I bought 3 gutairs a few years back, my fingers just are not big enough to wrap arount the fret! i stink at it. ive got 2 fenders and an ibinezz
Wow that's super cool, but unfortunate that your hands are too small. I'd love to try out one of those guitars!
theyre just collecting dust now, gonna sell them up on ebay!
What are some craziest things you did when you were a hippie?
Yeah, I think I ran across some of his performances on YouTube at some point. I could listen to violin and cello music all the time if I had the opportunity. I like to put on videos in the background to provide some background noise. And an occasional distraction.
It was a life without any worries and did a lot of good and bad things, and if you are finding a match I seriously advise do not look for hippes.
LOL Well I would be carful now so what exactly do you do as animal rights worker?
Well we mainly try to get the awareness to the public for the safety of animals.
Well that is good work and I see that you like to have pets as kitties, so what color you dyed your hair?
I tried dark brown this time and you should try it as well, so how much you earn from gas station?
Well they pay very less and I am happy that my dad helps me as well.
That is good so what your dad do for living?
He is a school teacher and has better earnings for both of us.
So if you don't mind if I may ask what happend to you mom?
Well my parents got divorced like 4 years ago and moved on.
Yes, I love listening to classic or baroque if I'm doing something that needs concentration.  Do you listen to music when you ride your bike?
Sorry to hear that and well best of luck with your profile and blind dates.
Why do you want to become a nurse?
I love helping people!  And my mom was a nurse and I was always so proud of her and saw how much the work meant to her!  What made you get into the music industry?
Not surprisingly, because I love music. Got lucky that way. Are you you nursing school? I forget.
Yes, I'm still in school.  I have one year left.  I can't wait til I'm done.  Working and going to school is so difficult!  I spend all night serving drinks to drunks at a bar and all day in the hospital doing clinicals and then I study until I go to the bar to work again!  It's exhausting!
I'd imagine it would be! Kudos to you for balancing the two. I don't think I could do that. Any fun classes right now?
I took all my classes the first couple years so now I'm basically just doing the work of a nurse for free in the hospitals!  A licensed nurse just follows me around and tells me what to do and supervises me so I get hands on experience.  It's better than being in a classroom but I can't wait until I can actually get paid to do it!
I'd imagine. Honestly, that sounds a like exploitative. You should at least get minimum wage or something!
Yeah but instead I have to pay tuition to do it!  It does seem exploitative, doesn't it?  How's your dog doing?
She's doing really well! Actually had a client come by the studio yesterday who showed up with a steak from Ruth Chris as just gave it to her. Must be nice to be that rich.
I should. Usually I'm listening to podcasts when I'm riding my bike. Since I don't have much time I try to keep abreast of current events that way.
Wow!  If I could afford that good of a steak I would most certainly not be sharing it with a dog!!!  Hopefully once I get these student loans paid off someday I can eat like that!  What kind of dog do you have again?  I never remember
A lab. She gobbled the thing down. And gave me a look like, "How come you never feed me anything like that!" I bet it'll be nice to have those loans paid off.
For sure!  Should take a few years though from what I've calculated!  College isn't cheap!  I'm surprised she's even eating her dog food now and not holding out for steak again!  Ha!  I might do that if I realized there was something better out there!
I want to visit your place. I have never been there.
My place is full of potatoes and onions. If you wanted to see lots of that then please do come by soon. I can give you some of my crops.
Cool! I love potatoes and onions! Do you happen to grow any fruit by chance? I'll have to take a trip over there soon!
The only fruit I grow is the sweet fruit I have with my husband. We grow the sweet relationship we have together.
I thought you were divorced? Is this a second marriage if you don't mind me asking?
I'm sorry. He left me a couple years ago and I am still having flashbacks when he was still here with me. I still love him.
It's okay! I completely understand. I hope you are happy and content with life after marriage! Personally I have never had the opportunity to get married. Probably for the better.
Yes, that's a good time to kill two birds with one stone.  I've never really gotten into podcasts.  What type of podcast topics do you listen to?
You can always marry yourself because you travel so much, you will always have yourself.
Haha, I always tell everyone I am married to the money! Freedom and travel are my virtues
I like money too. Money is the tool for the expression of freedom.
I'm sure farming grants you the opportunity to make a lot of money
The money I get from farming come from providing people with quality food products. It's a warm and wholesome type of currency.
What is it like in North Carolina? I have never been to that place.
The weather is good here most of the year, though sometime it gets cold as well, how is in New Mexico?
Most of the year its warm here, so what kind of music do you mainly like?
I like the country music specially when I am on longer road trips.
I bet this would be fun, how is the working enviornment at grocery stores?
I just take naps to relieve stress. So do you have a mini chemistry lab in you home?
Its always busy here as everyone come to buy dat to day needs and I hope you are busy at book store
Exactly as books selling seems getting obsolete due to everything is online now.
you are right as the technology has replaced lots of things, what else do you do beside dancing for fun.
Well I enjoy taking my dog to the dogpark and socialize with other pet onwers. how about you?
I also enjoy the weather by going to parks and mostly for jogging.
that is good excercise and my dog helps me to run behind him a lot.
Well its good that everyone thinks about their health.
I just had a Whataburger for lunch. It was good!
I love it, but I will surely get tired of it working here.
As a customer, I love it. Their burgers are super fresh and made with high-quality meat and ingredients. I'm sure it's a drag to work there, but I've never worked in food service before.
No I don't. I have no space for it.
It's temporary until my father starts training me at his construction company. We aren't lose, but he wants me to take over the company.
Do you prefer working in construction? How do you feel about someday taking over the family business?
I've honestly never done it. I suppose I'm trying to earn my father's love by taking it over.
That's tough that your father hasn't been really affectionate towards you. Do you wish you had a more loving relationship with him?
Of course. Growing up, he just gave me "stuff",
Well I wish the best for you. Maybe working part-time doing construction for him would help strengthen your bond. The new job I got is actually doing manual labor working for my friend. It's very physically demanding but I have to pay my bills somehow.
Very true! And at least you know you like your boss!
That is a plus, for sure. Friendship is different, though, in a business context. Sometimes it's hard to listen to him bossing me around.
I can imagine. At least I'm used to my dad bossing me.
What is the secret to staying married for 20 years?
The 68 is a daily driver, at least during the summer.  The Hertz clone is a trailer queen.  I'm too afraid of paying for on  the road insurance.
That's too bad, I would be happy to lend you one of mine if you do end up getting space for one. Are you still in the Canadian Army?
Communication and compromise. Something I think is important beyond that, is realizing people grow and change. Don't assume your partner is the exact same person you married. Keep getting to know them. Are you married?
That is such a very important point, especially when you've married young. No, I am not married; not sure if that's in the cards for me.
Well, I don't think anyone should push you. Anyway,,, do you really want to share your closet space? You can buy all the shoes you want :).... How many pairs do you have?
Exactly! Honestly, I stopped counting a couple of years ago. Thankfully I have three bedrooms and live alone!
that's neat! It's like having several walk in closets. My wife has about 50 shoes. She loves colorful sneakers the most. Do you have more casual shoes than fancy shoes?
Most are very practical shoes, I'd like to still be able to use my feet in the future! lol What keeps you at work late?
Oh, they are always changing the insurance stuff and I have to input the information all over again. It can be tedious. What kind of work do you do?
It's not the easiest to explain exactly, I'm kind of an inventor...I tinker around a lot with solar cells and create possible applications for their use.
The solar industry is booming the last few years. Do you use a lot of solar energy in your home?
Oh yes! I live in the desert so it's quite practical for me. I spend much of my time at home so I really appreciate it.
No, I was never in the army.
I need to add more solar power to our home. Any ideas where I could start out small?
How was time with your kids?  Were you able to read after?
Yes I was. It was a peaceful reading. What Netflix show did you end up starting?
I've been watching this show called "Shameless". It's about a dysfunctional family headed up by a degenerate drunk named Frank, and it chronicles their hustles, scandalous behavior, and struggle to survive. Have you seen it?
Haha yes! I saw it many years ago when it first came out and never finished it. It is super crazy and I can never get over how there is always something going on with that family.
That Gallagher family sure is nuts! It's a pretty edgy show with a lot of bad language, sexual situations, and alcohol abuse. Are your kids old enough to watch it?
Oh no, and even if they were I would not want them to. It made me even feel some type of way so I could only imagine their little minds trying to figure out what is going on. Do you have any plans this weekend?
How old are they? I bet they think it's super cool that their parent is a doctor! I'll be volunteering at the shelter all day Saturday, and I have a daytime wrestling match on Sunday.
2, 10, & 13. They are a good age but still need to be protected from crazy shows like that haha That sounds like a pretty interesting weekend. Maybe we can stop by the shelter.
I'd rather see you guys after work. I'd love to watch some Disney movies if you're up for that.
Really, I must have been mistaken. Was anyone in your family in the army or a millitary branch?
I am, and I am sure the kids would love to see you again. Maybe next time we can stop by and help as well. I know the older ones are interested in volunteering.
Your 13 year old kid is old enough to volunteer. We'd love the extra help!
I will let her know so she can get ready for that day. Maybe this summer when school is out. Then we can save and all go to Disneyland!
Have you thought about taking your dog with you on long walks to make them more enjoyable?
I have! I actually just took my dog on a walk this morning it was a beautiful day. What is your favorite thing to do with your black lab?
My grandson has been coming over to teach him how to catch frisbees.  I really enjoy watching him catch them.  I also enjoy going on long walks with him, his name is Chocolate (in Spanish). What is your dog's name?
That is so nice that you get to see your grandson more often! chocolate is a great name for a dog. My dogs name is tyson. How many grandchildren and children do you have? It must be nice to see your family expand so much.
Tyson's a nice name.  I have two children and four grandchildren.  It is such a blessing to have them nearby.. I have really enjoyed watching them grow!
That is a big happy family! Also it is nice that you have your family living so close. How long have you lived in florida for?
I have lived here for 30 years.  How about you? Do you have any children/grandchildren?
No, not at all. I thought you were in the Army?
I have two children ages 1 and 3. Two boys. I live in tennessee and my wife has to deal with a house full of boys haha. I am really enjoying my family at this age.
Oh wow! Yes, those are some pretty rambunctious ages.  I am sure you both have your hands full!  What do you do for a living?
Yea we don't always get enough sleep between us but that's the way it goes I guess! I am a mailman and have been for about 3 years. I enjoy my job for the most part it pays the bills and allows my wife to stay home with the kids. How about you, what do you do for work?
I am now retired but I used to be a teacher.  I taught mostly elementary school for 25 years. I really enjoyed teaching.  Do you have any hobbies?
I really enjoy eating burgers and fries and watching sports when I can get some spare time. I don't mind putting on a few extra pounds for now! I have a lot of respect for teachers now that I am older with kids of my own. Teachers should be paid like doctors in my opinion. Where in florida do you like to walk on your spare time?
I have started alternating my runs with bike rides so that I might be able to someday complete a triathlon.
That's an awesome goal! And good idea to start training with the bikes. Any particular triathlon you want to do?
Not yet.  Just trying to get my bearings and familiar with it all.  After getting my bike riding down, plan to move onto swimming.  Any tips?
Don't drown? Just kidding! Probably not a lot I can offer you except to not try to do too much at one time. With all the running and now biking you do, you should have good lung capacity for swimming but it can be overwhelming if you try to go to fast at the beginning. I think I might need to start doing some running and biking and maybe we can travel and do our first triathlon together!
That would be great.  Your right, I don't plan on doing everything at once.  Get biking down and then move on.  You're welcome to join me on my runs.
Yes I am, I am still a part of the Canadian Army. My contract lasts for about two years from now. I dropped out of college for it, but I might be interested in going back after my contract expires. Are you planning on continuing your education after college?
Thank you and I think I will do that. Going to take me awhile to build up to a marathon though. Do you have any tips for me on running? Should I try a 5k first?
Take your time. if your not use to running start out walking and each day try to increase your speed.   Stretching before and after is extremely important.  A 5k would be a good start if your use to running.  It will give you a sense of where your at with your abilty.
Sounds like a plan. Hopefully when I'm ready to try biking, I can remember how. It's been years since I've been on a bike. Not a whole lot time to run and bike when I'm out sailing my yacht. You should come for a short sail on my yacht sometime! We can head up and down the west coast and see some cool sights!
Oh that would be great.  I love the west coast.  Have you been to San Francisco bay?
Yes! I love sailing through there! I love docking there and seeing the seals! I'm originally from Texas so we don't have many seals there. We'll have to plan a trip soon then!
Yes we will.  The food at fisherman's wharf is amazing.  What are some other places you've sailed to on the west coast?
Completely agree! I guess we know where we'll have to stop to eat. I love sailing down the coast to San Diego also! San Francisco is nice but can get a little cool but San Diego is always perfect! Maybe we can plan it as a little recovery trip after you finish the LA Marathon this year!
Where was the last place that you traveled to?
Canada, to go model at a fashion show
How long do your trips usually last?
No, I am done with school. I plan on starting a small business. Have you ever owned a business?
A week or so. So which restaurant do u go often to eat your mexican food
There are a couple nearby that I go to once in a while; however, I really like to do the cooking myself.
Do the cooking yourself. I thought construction workers do not really have time to do sure?.
I always make time to have a great meal!
That is good. So which UFC match you watched last?
Usman vs Masvidal, this past weekend. Have you ever seen a match?
No, I haven't. I don't really like the sport, judt like you do not like traveling
Hold on, it's not that I don't like to travel; I just don't have much time to do so. That is something I'd like to change...soon.
ok then. I will love you to create time for it
All the talk about ice cream earlier made me go out and get some chocolate ice cream at the store.
No I have not, seems like a challenge to me. What kind of business are you interested in starting?
What is your favorite brand of chocolate ice cream? I like Breyer's.
I like any brand, as long as it is plain chocolate. Have you been to any concerts?
Yeah, I actually went to see a friend's band play this past weekend. Do you like listening to music?
I do like some music, but the only concerts I get to are the ones I take my kids to.
What kind of concerts do your kids like to go to?
They like country music concerts. Do you like country?
I'm more of a bluegrass/western person myself. Do they have a favorite artist?
I am not sure about a favorite artist. I think they'd listen to any.
Well, that's good. Having a favorite anything can really limit growth. How old is your oldest child?
My youngest is almost 10 years old! Do you have kids?
I want to own my own bookstore.
I asked about your oldest, actually. No, I don't have any children and don't intend to.
When would you like to start traveling
When the travel ban is lifted
Where would you like to visit
I will love to go to Australia because of my volunteered job
Wow, sounds good, how long will you like to stay
A month. So what about your fish?
I am a country person and love to fish. Tell me a little more about your volunteer job
Homeless shelter. when are going hiking again?
I don't really hike, there is a lake 2 miles from where live.
That sounds cool, I'm sure it will work out well for you given your experience in working in a bookstore. Are you considering in specializing in a specific genre to sell?
Did you take Barnaby for a walk yet?
Yes I did, what about your pet cow
I usually walk with him throughout the field. I don't want him to get loose and cause and mayhem. What kind of trails do you like to do with your dog?
walking with my dog on trails is what I do most and I lose my cow when my parent sold their farm
How do you like your Taurus? I was thinking about getting one.
My ford is really good. You can go for it. who is your best musician
I really like The Offspring. I really want to go to one of their concerts. What about you? Who do you like?
I don't really like music, so no best musician. So how do manage your truck
It works really well. Sometimes it is tough to get into parking spots, because it is pretty big. But I like it. How's work going?
Work is good. Hope you are get contract with your electrical jobs
No, not really. I intend to have a vast sellection. What do you do for fun?
Ya, things are going well. I am pretty busy these days.
wow, that's good. The job I am doing is quite boring though
Would you like to go shopping with me this weekend. I found an antique car shop.
I would be more than happy to!  Is there anything specific you are looking for car-wise?
Yes, I am looking for old Porsche in the 1960's
Oh I love how Porsches look!  I don't know too much about what would make it a good buy or not, but I'd love to look.  How much are you looking to spend?
I don't have a lot of money, hopefully around $20,000
Well hopefully we will have some good luck!  Say, have you thought about getting a dog?  I know how much you like them.
I love dogs. Do you have a dog, if yes, how many
Yes, I have a golden retriever named Sally.  She's a total sweetheart.  Would you ever consider getting a dog/
How long have you been doing this?
How was your week as a librarian?  Did you get any new books in?  How much longer do you have until you retire?
Yes, I would like a dog, but I am having a hard time deciding what type of dog to get, can you give me a suggestion
Absolutely! Since you enjoy the outdoors, I think you would do best with a more medium or large-sized dog.  Maybe a retriever or a collie.  Boxers are also a lot of fun!
Yes, I was thinking about a Boxer, but I don't know much about a Boxer
They are amazing dogs!  They are so sweet and cuddly, but they do love getting out and burning off some energy.  When they get excited, they run in circles and chase their tails...it's so cute!
So, are your sons all of a similar age and able to play little league together?
sons are 11,10,nine,eight and seven. Yes they all play little league together
That must be so much fun, but very busy! Did you play baseball as well?
yes i was a pitcher in high school. I have 5 german shepards too, maybe you could walk them for me!
Ah okay it must be nice to watch your sons follow in your footsteps. I'll take your dogs out, definitely gonna have my hands full with 5 dogs LOL. Maybe I'll bring my chihuahua too
my dogs love all little dogs! we all pile into the van, go to the games! id love for you to see a game, come and bring your dog
I think I will retire in 5 years, but I want to  work part-time in 6 months.  I hope my manger will let me.
They'd get along great with my dog ChiChi then! I don't understand baseball but maybe you could teach me
nothing to learn really, but ill bring a huge thermos of coffee for us, do you take cream and or sugar? we'll make a date
Yeah I usually take cream and sugar, I like my coffee sweet! I'll also bring some donuts and orange slices for snacks for the kids after the game.
ok ill get in touch with you when the season starts back up. im going to try attempt to take the boys kayaking!  oh boy!!!!
Good luck, wish I was heading out today too!! Hopefully the weather is nice for you all too! I think I will do some reading today.
weathers always nice - happy reading
You won't believe who came into the bookstore yesterday!
Hmm, probably not. Who was it?
Thom YORKE!!!! I could've believe it.
I'm not familiar with that person. Who are they?
Good for you! That's always exciting knowing when you plan to retire. My wife still has a long way to go before then. What do your kids do?
Are you serious George? You're joking right?
Nah, not joking. I haven't a clue who that is.
And you all yourself a fan of Radiohead. I'm shocked.
We play music like Radiohead. I never said I was a fan of them per say. Besides, I don't really keep up with the names of people in bands if I'm honest. I just like the music.
Wait, so you make music like a band you don't even really listen to or are a fan of? George, I don't fully understand you musicians I guess.
Yeah, I guess I'm a little weird there. It's happened before where people have been talking about a member from a popular band and I had no clue who they were on about.
It's alright. Just giving you a hard time. Sometimes I meet someone in person and two minutes later I don't remember their name.
I'm the same way. I'm really bad with names as well. In one and out the other.
I bought some new running pants.
Nice what color of pants you bought as I bet it would be blue or like that!
They have finished their studies, one is a lawyer, the other is a carpenter. I don't have grandkids.
Well you are right it is blue, I am sure if you buy it will be green right?
You bet it would be, so what kind of rescue you do for pets?
Mostly the abandoned pets where ever we find, so what kind of cat you have?
I have a black cat and I love her and I always take her with me for running practice.
That is so nice, so how is the new job going on?
Well its ok not too interesting though, I wonder what happens in shipyards?
Well i use my experience and fix the ships and sometime also go as a merchant.
Wow you must be brave enough to spend days in the ocean as it scares me.
Yep it is something requires a lot of patience.
I bet it is as some ships spent months in ocean I heard.
My children are very young and have just started school. The oldest is only in their junior year of high school. Their grandfather helps me take care of them from time to time.
I found a new online dating platform for people in their 60's.
That is neat.  I might take a look at it to see what's out there.  You think there are any takers for an ol' librarian like me?
Absolutely! your a wonderful conversationalist. I'm sure you would make someone very happy
We will see.  I have wanted to go travel when I retire.  I may go back to Spain.  Maybe.... you would like to go?  It would be a fun girls trip.
Travelling to a place like Spain right now makes me nervous. Maybe better to stay in New England
I get it.  Overseas travel can be worrisome.  So, if your not going overseas, where do you like to travel to?
I mostly want to go to places where I won't run into people whose attitudes don't conflict with mine
I see.  It makes sense.  I like to see the world as much as possible.  You get tired of reading about places in a library.  It creates a desire to see these locations.  I plan to go to Iceland soon also.
Yes, Iceland sounds like a nice place. They are very insular and maintain a safe space for their residents.
Yes.  The views, I have read, are amazing.  Of course, I will have to try out this dating platform you found so I can have someone to share it with.
I would gladly help my children with their kids. I hope I am not too old and out of fashion. I have still not read the Face Book, I have heard it is quite popular with the young people.
Dating platforms are very popular. You would certainly have alot to choose from.
I hope so.  I will be patient and take my time though.  I want to make sure it is someone I am compatible with.
I have never been to Disney, but hope to take my children there someday
How many kids did you save you have again? I have two brothers and a sister.
I have two kids. One boy and one girl! They are my pride and joy! I am an only child. How long have you been in Karate for? And do you enjoy it?
I'm not in karate! I think you might be thinking of another kid. I don't like karate. My older brother is in karate though.
Ah my apologies! Have you seen Frozen 2 yet?
Yes!!! I think it is as exciting as Frozen. But the songs in frozen are better. My favorite is do you want to build a snowman. But I know you don't like Disney that much.
Yeah unfortunately I am somewhat unfamiliar with the movie but my children are obsessed with it! I really need to take them to Disney world as soon as possible!
I am looking forward to our family's trip this summer soooooo much! Maybe you could talk to my Mom and we could all go together! Your kids would love it.
I think we all get too old and out of fashion at some point! Facebook is still popular with the younger generation, although newer sites like Instagram and TikTok are becoming more appealing. I think I am too old as I don't understand those either!
I would love for my children to be able to experience the world of Disney! They would be ecstatic! Thank you for the offer! I look forward to talking about this with your parents!
sounds fun. How old are your boy and girl?
My son Is 4 and my daughter is turning 6 in a month! Crazy how time flies! I think you would get along with them great! How old are your siblings?
Nine and six and five years old
How old are your grandkids?
One is 5 and one is 3
Awww, that is such a fun age. Have you taken them to the zoo recently?
We have actually never gone to the zoo before. We spend a lot more time in house than out. We love to color and do all kinds of crafts.
I am finding a lot of fun things to do online. I feel that is the best teaching as well since it can be fun and educational all at once.
It has been hard for me to get into the internet. You can call me pretty old school. Since i am a librarian, i really have a deep value for books. However, my grandson, the 5 year old, is teaching me a lot of things via his tablet. It really can be quite educational, and a lot of information very quickly.
I guess being old does not give a license to stop learning. I wonder what activities I would do with my grandkids. Why your kids like shopping at the Home Depot ?
I do not understand how little ones knows so much about technology. I keep hearing that kids are the ones teaching the older generation and I have yet to see it to believe it.
Oh yes! Believe me, i would know nothing about the internet if it were not for my grandson! I usually sit down with a cup of tea and relax next to the grandkids, while they either play on their tablet or teach me how to use it. I definitely did not have anything like it while i was growing up.
I agree. I was lucky if it was my turn in school to even use the computer that day. And living on a farm also limits the amount of internet time I get. The other day we had a storm and I had no internet for weeks.
Wow! That must have been so difficult to handle. I am used to no internet, however, i think my kids and especially my grandkids would go crazy if they didnt have it for even a couple hours.
haha I know! Some of us have been so dependent on internet that once everything is gone we do not know what to do with ourselves. Or at times I have heard of people taking it away as a form of punishment.
Yes! That is defintely what my daughter does to my grandkids! They really listen then!
Sorry I didn't make it to the playground. How are you friends. I hope you had fun without me.
It's okay, I didn't want to go anyways but my other friends forced me. They're doing good, but I wish they understood that I'd rather spend time online than go to the playground.
I wish I could spend more time online! I want to go on Twitter but my parents won't let me. You're lucky that you're allowed!
I think it's because my mom wants me to learn about a lot of other people and how the world works. It's on Twitter that we found out about the feminist march happening later. You should ask your parents if you can join!
That's very true. My children like the Home Depot because their grandfather used to work there. I used to take them there to browse and say hi to grandpa every once and a while. Do your kids ever come and see you?
Oh that sounds interesting, but I don't think they will let me go. They won't even let me go shopping by myself.
That stinks! I'll have to tell you about it in class on Monday then! Speaking of class, did you finish the homework assignment yet? I really wish we didn't have to write about Disney and Mickey Mouse!
I can't wait to hear about it! Yeah I've done the assignment! I love Mickey Mouse so much and I really want to go to Disney World! This assignment has made me want to go even more! Don't you like Disney?
No way, Mickey Mouse is boy! Besides, women rule the world, so why waste time writing about some old guy?
But Micky Mouse is so cool! I still like him even though I'm a girl. Okay women rule the world but Mickey can join in too! I want to go surfing with him!
Well you can go surf with Micky Mouse, and I'll stay on the beach surfing the web. Or maybe I'll go fishing so we can have fresh fish for dinner! Isn't organic food always the yummiest?
Alright that's a plan. Eugh, I hate fish and I can't tell whether a food is organic or not. I just want to play with my friends.
You can tell food is organic because it tastes fresh and crisp! But if you're not used to it, it can be hard to tell. Maybe at school we can play farmers and grow our own organic food!
What car is your favorite?
My favorite car is Lamborghini. what about you?
Well they come to see time to time ? I guess they will come more often when they'll need a baby sitter. Do you see your father often ?
I'm not sure any more. I have lost interest in cars for the most part. I would love a Tesla though! Which Lamborghini do you like?
Tesla is a good car for environmental. I like the aventador however I don't have money for that
Not many people do! Being good for the environment is great and all but I just think the technology is the future and I'd like to play with it. But, they are out of my price range.
Yes, they are expensive however I know a person which the company help him to buy the Tesla, I don't know which was the company but I think it's very interesting. I think in the future, Tesla will have a better price
The Tesla may be slightly more in reach than the Lamborghini, this it true. You get some good tax write off too I'm told. So, you liked Narcos?
Yes, I like, what about you?
I liked it a lot. Was a history lesson of sorts. I wish there were more of them!
Yes, it is good for it. Do you like park?
I do. The park is nice because of the lack of traffic. Automobile traffic that is. You can relax and pay less attention. Have a park near you that you frequent?
No, there isn't any park near me however I can drive to the closest park, I need a relax moment for myself.
Ummmm, off and on, since 1989.  It's a hobby that takes a lot of devotion.  It can be expensive, but it doesn't always have to be.
That's nice to hear. We see my father almost every weekend. We take the kids and try to do something fun with the whole family.
Have you tried any new ways to eat fries? My might want to try chili cheese fries.
No, I haven't tried anything different. I don't like chilli cheese. Tell me after eating it, if you like it
I will definitely let you know. Have you been dancing recently?
Yes, 5 days a week I dance. What about you?
No, I have not done much dancing recently. What is your favorite style of dance?
My favorite style of dance is samba. What about you?
I think my favorite style is probably the waltz. It's so very fun to watch. Have you ever taken dance classes?
Yes, I have because I am not good on dancing. What about you?
You dance five days a week and have taken lessons but are not good at dancing?
Yes, because I am learning. I am not a professional.
What kind of fun activities ?
You don't have to be a professional to be good at dancing.
Yes, I know, but I am not a good dancer, my friends laughed the last time they saw me dancing. Are you goog at dancing?
Do you and your dad get along?
We get along really well, actually. I live with my Mom and Dad and Dad and I are training to run a marathon together this Summer. How long has your dad been a farmer?
He has been farming his entire life. He grew up on a farm and I did also. Good luck to you and your dad in the marathon!
Thank you! I might need it. I always listen to music while I run. We should go to a rock concert sometime, that's my favorite. There's a venue near your farm, if you want to go sometime.
You are welcome! I have never ran a marathon. I love rock music and I get that from my dad also. We always listen to the great classic rock songs when we are farming. I would like to attend a concert with you anytime something is near enough for both of us to attend!
Have you ever gotten hurt from riding horses? I can always help you with training, I want to get better so I can be a physical therapist for athletes like my Dad one day.
Yes. I have been thrown a few times and only suffered minor injuries. I have had all the training I need, but Thank you! I've been riding horses before I could walk. I have a Bachelors degree in Biology and could also help you if the need ever arose.
Oh wow! I love Biology. It's great to know how natural systems work. From running marathons to farming to riding horses, it's essential. Do you sell your crops mostly, or do you donate some of your food to the needy?
How was your week working construction?  DId you go home after work and have tacos?
We sell and donate our crops. We sell first and then we let anyone in the community or anyone come and harvest what they need for free. My Biology degree is helpful sometimes for the farming, but I have just alwats been drawn to the sciences and what makes thi
What a rewarding and peaceful life! I am excited to graduate so that I can finally find something as fulfilling. I never even see fields here, just running tracks, parking lots, and sidewalks. We will have to go to that outdoor concert venue soon!
I look forward to hearing about your graduation. How many semesters do you have left? Farming is a peaceful and rewarding environment. It feels good to know you are helping people to eat! You will have to visit our farm when we go see the concert together. I would like to show you around the farm and show you how things work. Let's make a date soon.
I have three semesters left and then college for physcial therapy. I would love to learn what foods are healthiest and get some advice on nutritional facts since I am going into physical therapy/training. I have Spring break in two weeks. I'd love to come see the farm,if you're free!
I ditched that Keto diet, it was too hard.
Have you been to a rascal flats concert?
I have!  I went once with my husband. They and Kenny Chesney went on tour together.
How awesome!! It must of have been so much fun,how long did you have to wait in line for those tickets?
We bought the tickets online so we didn't have to wait in line.  We even had a Rascal Flatts song as our wedding song.  What is your favorite song by them?
You dodged a bullet with that one, the lines for that must of been long. How nice your wedding must have been, I'm sure I would of loved it. I dont know any of their songs I mainly like britney spears. Did you sing at your wedding also?
My week was decent. And yes, I did get tacos after work. Thanks for asking. How was your week?
No I don't sing.  I like Britney Spears as well.  I actually like most music.  There's not much I don't like.  What song do you like from Britney?
I think it's an older song called Hit me baby one more time, you know now that you mention it I think I've heard the latest Rascal Flats song and it sounds really catchy, do you know what it's called?
Oh ya!  That was her first hit.  She had that video where she looked like a cheerleader.  I haven't heard the new Rascal Flats song.
O too bad. I do like it though. All of her songs are my favorite, what's yours?
I can't just pick one song, but I do really like her early stuff.  It reminds me of being a teen.
yea those were the days huh lol..me too
My salsa teacher told me I was the best dancer in the class and invited me to a training class to become a teacher!
Oh wow congratulations! Will that be a career opportunity for you?
I would love for that to be my career one day! Does your religion allow you to dance? It can be used as meditation too.
Yes! Dancing is a large part of Buddhism, so I'd like to do it more often. How often do you salsa dance?
My week was great! I have been  studying Mexican cuisine. When we get a chance to hand out I will have to make some fish taco for you.
I go 2 times a week for class and 1 time a week for training class. I would love to go everyday but I can't. What type of dancing do you do? I would love to learn about it.
3 times is pretty good, it seems like a good workout too! And I really enjoy line dancing with friends. Do you do any other types of dancing?
Yes it is a great workout! I also love to line dance with my friends, we have so much in common, lol.
Haha yeah we do! I'd love to take one of your salsa classes once you become a teacher!
That sound great! I will let you know as soon as I have my first class. Not to change the subject but what does non-verbal mean? Does that mean you don't speak and only write?
Yes exactly! Basically I don't verbally speak but I use my phone to communicate with friends and family. It was difficult at first but I'm used to it now and have really enjoyed my non-verbal journey! Would you ever go non-verbal?
I could give it a try, but I love talking so much. Does that affect your work or school?
I work as a pilot but am currently on sabbatical so I haven't flown since I've been non-verbal. We will see if I'll continue when I go back to work. And yeah it sounds like it would be hard for you then lol
Do you ever play fantasy football?  I know a lot of football fans like playing that.
I tried it one season because a bunch of people at work were really into it. But, I have to say, I didn't really like it much. I'd rather just watch it and enjoy the games.
That sounds awesome, thanks. Besides Mexican cuisine, are there any other cuisines you enjoy?
I get that. So, you excited about Najee Harris? Think he was a good pick for the steelers?
I think the kid has some potential. We'll definitely find out if he has what it takes in the NFL. He was solid at Alabama though.
Those Alabama running backs have been a little hit or miss. But I think he should be decent enough. Hopefully Ben has something left in his arm right?
Yeah, I think he has something left. I think the Steelers have four quarterbacks with the Rudolph extension deal.
Hopefully someone works out then. Is it easy to watch the games from up there?
I have like three different cable channels that cover the NFL up here. Probably not as good as in the states.
Bet it's still easier than me trying to follow gymnastics in the states!
I bet. How does one follow that sport as far as watching it on t.v.?
They sometimes air the college championships. And then the olympic trials and actual olympics. It hit or miss otherwise.
I always enjoy watching it when it comes around on the olympics. I really admire the strength in the rings event.
I also know a little bit of Japanese cuisine as well. I have been perfecting the art of making sushi rice. Do you eat raw meat ever?
What breed of dog you have?
We have a black Labrador. Do you know what they look like?
Hmm, not really sure besides being black. What do they look like then?
They're medium-sized and have long black hair that sheds everywhere! Their paws are webbed so they are very good swimmers.
Are they they kind of dogs that like to play?
Yes! They are retrievers. They love when you throw a ball into the water. They swim out and bring it back. Do you like to play with dogs?
I've never had one so I don't really know. When I watch YouTube videos of people with dogs it looks like fun.
Why don't you ask your parents if you can come to the lake with me and the kids and Bear (the dog). They could come too.
They might freak out if they find out the dog's name is Bear.
He's very sweet! I can talk to them about the dog if they want.
Yes, I love sushi. I prefer cooked fish over raw, but I don't mind it at all. Your favorite Japanese cuisine?
Yeah, it would probably be a good idea. My parents are kind of protective and worry a lot.
That's what parents do. I remember it can be annoying sometimes, but they just love you more than you can imagine.
Have you crocheted anything lately?
I've been working on a baby blanket, but it's going very slowly. What about you? Any projects on the go?
I'm making a blanket for myself. Being 60, I always feel cold and damp. So, it might help me to warm myself up. By the way how's your sister?
She's doing great. The blanket is actually for her daughter who's pregnant. I'm sorry to hear you always feel cold and damp. I doubt you'd come camping with me!
Oh I'd love to go, but I'm near my retirement now, so I am spending my time working for some more time till I'm unable to.
I understand, but getting outside is a great way to balance out the work life. You can read while you camp!
Well, you're right. Let me see if I can make it happen. I'd love to go to camping if you will prepare me a nice dish.
Oh, that's one of my expertise. Cooking on an open fire. I really do enjoy it. I will make something special. You can bring the books, okay?
Well my roots are in Italian cuisine. I make lots of pasta everyday and I have learned how to cut noodles into 10 different shapes. My favorite shape is the wagon wheel.
You know better than me that I never leave my house without my books.
Yes, being a librarian, I bet you've got all the inside scoop on the good reads! I enjoy thrillers, but nothing too gory, please.
I don't like gore myself. I would rather prefer a suspense thriller murder mystery where the MC has to solve clues to get to the killer.
Yes, and if you read carefully enough, you can solve the crime!
How are you feeling now? Not too lonely I hope.
I always feel good because I have superpowers.
That's great! You are lucky. Are you excited to the flower girl at my wedding?
I don't know, I'm pretty small and might not be a good flower girl.
I think you'll be a great flower girl. That's why I asked you! We will practice so you can see how easy it is.
What do we need to practice before the wedding? Am I going to carry big bags of flowers around?
Wow, that sounds amazing. I can imagine how tasty it'll be. I see you like seafood, favorite dish?
No. You will have a small basket of flower petals, and you get to toss them around. It's fun! We practice so we can see how much fun the wedding will be and won't be nervous that day.
Yeah, it sounds like it might be kind of fun. I bet you are really getting nervous before your wedding.
A little bit. Maybe I will trip! You're lucky that you can stop time. If you don't like the way you threw the petals you can stop time and pick them up and start all over!
Or, if I see you starting to trip I can stop time, stop your fall, and get you to go again.
That would be great! You'll be the best flower girl ever!
Yay!!! Maybe I could start a business of being the flower girl that stops time.
What music you currently listening to.  Something country I am guessing.
Dolly, of course! How about you?
I do not hate Dolly! Good old school artist. I am actually listening to John Denver at the moment.
Dolly's having a concert this summer. Do you want to go with me?
So cool. Where I live they filmed the Shawshank Redemption.  I know some people who were doubles in it. I love horror but true crime is my favorite thing to read. What kind of books have you read so far this year? Any you recommend?
This sounds fun. Do you have any other hobby?
My favorite seafood by far would be steamed clams with a lemon and butter sauce on the side.  What kind of fish do you prefer?
I appreciate the offer, let me think about it. I like her, but do not know I could do an entire concert. When and where is the concert?
It's at the Boston Civic Center. She'll be there August 8-12. Are you planning to go to any concerts this summer?
Well I am free then, give me a week to think about it? It may be fun. I do not have any concerts scheduled yet, so I may have to go with you>
I'd love that! If you find any concert you'd rather go to, let me know. I could go to both.
I will have to do some research on upcoming concerts and find one. I love the idea! I go to Dolly, you go to one with me!
Perfect! And don't worry, Dolly puts on a great show. And she's just adorable.
Would you prefer something closer to John Denver genera or Nirvana ?
Something more modern than John Denver could be fun.
How has Larry been doing in his classes?
Larry loves his trainer! Of course, most of the training is for me. We owners need help...lol.. Do you own a pet?
I prefer fried squid. Though, I rarely eat seafood. When did you started listening to Aerosmith?
Nah, I don't. I've always thought about getting one but then I never do it.
Pets are so rewarding but they require a lot of care. My parents don't want a pet of their own but they like spoiling mine. What kind of work do you do now?
After I got fired at Petsmart I decided to go back to school. So, I'm a student now.
It sucks to be let go of from a job but maybe it will put you on a journey doing what you like to do. What is your major?
I haven't pick one yet. I'm thinking about going computer science. How do you like Chemistry? I found that tough in High School. Might have just been my crappy teacher.
I like chemistry! I just haven't found a job in that field that I want, so I am staying at Barnes and Nobles until I find a good fit. It pays the bills. Are you just taking the basic courses for now?
That's kind of why I want to pick something like computer science, there are lots of jobs in that field. Yeah, just taking the basics for now until I make up my mind.
Smart! My chemistry major is kind of the same. I started thinking about using my major in Forensic Science field. I would need to do some further training but I'm kinda burnt out on school.
You went to school for 4 years? That does seem like a long time so I better pick something that I enjoy or I'll burn out as well.
Just be sure to stop and smell the roses once and awhile. What kind of thing do you like to do on your free time?
Squid is another one of my favorites. It can be difficult to cook though. I am actually growing away from Aerosmith. I listened to them wayyyy too much this week.
I managed to take a trip out to see the birds with my kitty, it was great fun!
That sounds nice. Did you see any rare species while you were out bird watching?
There is a bald eagle nest near my house which we went to visit.  Have you ever seen a baby bald eagle before?
Wow that's great. No I haven't seen any Eagles let alone a baby. That must be amazing to see out in the wild. are they dangerous?
As long as you don't get to close they aren't too dangerous.  That's why binoculars are a birder's best friend! We watch from afar.
Well I was going to say isn't watching bird's with your cat a little bit dangerous for the birds? but to be honest I'm starting to worry for your cat LOL.
My cat is lazy and doesn't like to walk on her own. I have a stroller for her.  She is totally spoiled! Do you have any pets?
You have a stroller for your cat?! that sounds so crazy. I think she is spoilt yes. I'd love a snake but by parents won't allow me to have one. As soon as I get a place of my own I'll definitely get onw.
She's my baby since my kiddos are grown now.  Snakes are interesting pets. I don't think I could feed a pet snake mice. But if you have the stomach for that, I'm sure they make fun pets.
Yeah actually I know what you mean. I couldn't French a snake live mice. They would have to be captive bread frozen nice I think. I wouldn't get a large one, just a corn snake or something.
Have you been to any Aerosmith concerts? Do you have any plans to see them in the future?
I've never heard of a corn snake before. Sounds like you've put a lot of thought into getting a snake. I hope you can get one soon!
Yeah me too! they are quite small snakes so quite easy to look after, at least that's what I've read.
Have you been on any adventures with your pet giraffe Earl this week?
Yes, I took him to the soccer field with me and he watched me practice! How are the turtles?
They're good. I set up a race for them today. Water Melon Drea won. Can you ride your giraffe?
No he is too small to ride! Do your dolls still have their heads?
I still have them, but they're not on the dolls. They don't mind. Can you teach me to play soccer?
I would love to teach you to play soccer.  Its so much fun! Do you a soccer ball?
Yes. I am really bad at it. You might not want to play with me.
You don't have to be good as long as you don't mind running a lot!
How was harvesting today?  And was your pet cow in a good mood?  What is their name?
I love running! I am very fast.
Then you could be a forward and score all the points
I want to score all the points and be the star. Do you think you can beat me in a race?
Probably not but we could race like your turtles!
I got tickets to see Aerosmith live today! How you seen any live bands before?
I've seen ICP live before but not anyone else. I'm surprised Aerosmith is still doing tours.
I know, right? They're ancient. But I heard they still put on a good show. What are you doing this weekend?
I've got a roll playing session scheduled for this weekend. The system and setting we're using is pretty fun. Takes place in a future where magic becomes real.
That sounds cool. Can I join?
We could always use more people if role playing is your thing. I could help you learn about the settings and rules and help you come up with a character.
Pet cow is Mabel, she like to lay in the shade.  Harvest was not that good, had a big issue with Chinese lantern flies this year.
Thanks! I've done some role-playing, but it would help if you fill me in. How many people do you play with?
We have about 3 players (myself included among them) and the GM. We actually run a few different games so other players can take turns being the game master.
Do you want to come for pizza Thursday night and you can show me?
That sounds great! I'll bring over a copy of my rulebook and we can see if this is something you would like to try out.
Sounds good. I'll order. Sausage and peppers still your favorite?
You know it! You should try and brainstorm character ideas in the mean time. You can be pretty much anything you want.
Are you planning any trips for your upcoming summer?
Going to try and schedule another European tour if I can manage it. I'll probably visit Italy again and a few surrounding countries.
I would love to take my family to Italy for the summer. When did you go there last?
It has been about a year or two since my last visit. You and your family should really try to visit Italy at least once. Venice, Rome, Naples you can't go wrong.
I also like to lay in the shade, just like your pet cow, Mabel! How does a pet cow differ from a regular dairy cow, if you don't mind me asking?
We love Italian food and would go just to taste REAL italian cooking, haha. The sites would be a bonus. So being related to Columbus is why you enjoy sailing? A family love of the water?
Maybe. I was raised around water so I developed a pretty natural affinity towards it. No idea if Columbus' genes are so strong that they would have compelled me to sail and travel if I was raised a bit differently.
I was raised around water also but would much rather be on land. What kind of art are you studying in college?
I'm learning about all different kinds at the moment to learn about various styles. Everything from Rembrandt to Picasso.
That sounds amazing yet difficult. I think I will stick with learning more about gardening and the outdoors, haha. How much longer do you have in school?
Only about a year or so left until I earn my bachelors. Gardening is a pretty nifty skills to have. Artistry is nice but it notoriously doesn't always put food on the table.
When you earn your degree will you go on to teach others? Gardening gives an amazing feeling of accomplishment  for sure!
I don't really plan to be a professor, at least not right away. I'll have to see where the future takes me.
How were the cookies you made last week?
They were delicious, thank you. I made some chocolate chip cookie dough and I freeze it in individual cookie shapes. That night, I only cooked two for me. then I won't over eat. Do you like cookies and if you do, what kind is you favorite?
At a certain point, dairy cows cease to produce milk...my preference is to turn them into pets as opposed to dinner!
Yes I like cookies, chocolate chip are my favorite. How long did it take you to make them?
I take the amount i want out of the freezer and bake them for about a minute longer than if I baked them from unfrozen. About 13 min. I watch them so they won't  burn. How has work been?
It's been busy, but I like busy. It makes the time fly. How's your worbeen?
I had a lot of overtime this week at the office. My dog was missing me. You mentioned that you may get a dog next spring, what kind of dog are you wanting?
I would like to get a golden doodle. I had one years ago and he was great. How old is your dog?
Gabriel is 3. I have seen those golden doodles in pictures but I have yet to see one in person. I hope you find a reputable breeder to get the dog. Do you think there is a long waiting list?
I don't think so. I'll have to find out. What kind of things do you like to knit?
I am currently working on a sweater dress. I saw the pattern about 2 years back and I saved it until I felt confident to try. I am making it a smokey grey and I hope to be done by next winter. I bet your work and college leave little time for hobbies. What kind of hobbies do you like or wish to do?'
I like cooking and golfing. Don't get much golfing in though. Hopefully soon thought.
It is a great time of year to golf, I hope you get to do that soon
Sounds like you have a soft spot for animals! I couldn't agree more, I also did some farm work a few years back. We herded cattle using a herding dog, and a four wheeler. Pretty much just moved them to different pastures. Have you ever had to help deliver calves?
I could find any information on someone graduating Yale at 9. Is that really true.
Yes you can. By the way how did you color your hair like that? By yourself or went to a salon for it?
I went to a salon, they do a better job than I would do. What did you study at yale?
I did Electrical engineering and computer science at Yale.
Wow that is very advanced for age 9! I believe you though. What do you do for a living now?
I work for an MNC. It's a bit tough out here but I manage somehow. What is your cat's name?
That sounds like it could be hard work. Does your job relate to what you studied at yale? My cats name is tyson, he has grey hair and is very cuddly. He loves people!
Yes, it deals with building software's for corporations. I myself am a dog person but my spouse adores cats.
That must be helpful to continue your work in your field of study. What about your job is the toughest? I am a cat person myself but I truthfully love all animals!
Sometimes our clients requests are over the top. They must b =e thinking that creating a software is an easy job and they ask for features which can only be done with a specific hardware. But they keep on insisting that it will work through coding.
As an Amish farmer, I have done it all.  Have delivered calves, goats, sheep, foals...you name it.  All by hand here in Lancaster County!
That sounds so frustrating. Unfortunately, I think people don't understand how hard jobs are that require providing a service. Most of those clients of yours should give your job a try and see how it goes. How long have you and your spouse been together?
Around 12 years now and still going strong.
Have you done much gardening lately?
I am in my garden everyday
lucky you, I am in a detention center everyday
how do they treat you in detention center?
I have been treated better. If you keep to yourself, they would leave you along
you need to straighten out and dont steal, not worth it
stealing is fun, especially if you don't get caught.
not fun, not nice! no one would ever trust you
Well I do like to listen to classic country, and I do have my two dogs, "Baron Zemo" and "Spike."   What about you, how do you like wrestling as your day job?
Having grown up in Amish country, are you yourself Amish?
don't care what others think. I am going to do what I want to do.
better to ask for help if your having a hard time, there are people who do help
no one helps without wanting something. So where to you live? you have any nice stuff?
npt everyone wants something to help another, maybe as you get older youll realize that too
How are your dogs?
My dogs are doing great! I took them out for a walk today it was gorgeous weather. What is your favorite part about twitter?
Well, I don't actually have dogs so not great I suppose. How large of a city do you live in?
I live in a pretty large city in the Pacific Northwest. Not too big though its the right size for me. Do you live in a big city?
Not too big. I live on the East Coast. It's perfect for my family. Do you spend a lot of time on social media?
I spend little time on social media. However, I do enjoy checking in on people I know on facebook. What do you like to do on social media?
Yes, of course.  It's not an easy life, but an honest one that I am proud of.
I mostly chat for work. Occasionally I take and post pictures of my kids. And find groups of people with similar interests.
That is the part of social media that I do enjoy. It is cool that we have the ability to find so many people that have the same interests. Do you get paid to chat on twitter because you have so many followers?
I don't. I wish I did though. I never mind making a little extra money.  Ya know, I've never played Chess. Is it hard to learn?
Have you been able to go on a hike lately?  Do you take your dog with you?  What is his name?
My dog is named Max and yes he goes hiking with me.  He loves to chase deer.  I'll bet yall have some big deer in Canada.
Max is a very nice name! We do have big deer here, I see them quite often in the woods surrounding my parents' farm. Where do you usually go hiking at?
I undwind after a hard week at the office by going to my cabin by the lake.  It is at the foot of the South Axe Mountain.  Do the deer eat your crops?
Wow, that sounds very nice. I like to unwind by driving my truck around town, but if I enjoyed the outdoors more I would probably like to relax at a cabin like that. The deer are actually quite timid. They usually don't come close to the farm, and they mostly eat the berries and shrubs that grow in the woods.
Really? I have always heard that farmers have a hard time keeping the deer out of the crops.
Yup, the ones around here are not bothersome, which is quite nice. I think they get scared off from all of the loud noises the farm equipment makes. Are there lots of deer in Colorado too?
Wow! What an incredible amount of dedication you have! I absolutely admire that in today's world, you are staying true to your culture. Was being Amish a decision that you freely made or were you born into it?
Well I guess it's a good thing they are scared of tractors and such! Yeah I see them quite often around here.
It is a good thing for us! What other kinds of wildlife have you come across on your hikes? I've heard Colorado has a ton of wild animals.
oh yeah, turkeys, goats, bears, mountain lions.  You name it and we've got it.  That's one of the things I love about my state.  But tell me about the animals on your family farm.
Wow, such a wide variety! Very cool. We mostly grow crops on the farm, but we do raise chickens and a handful of cattle. The fresh eggs and milk make it all worth it.
These open poly relationships can be so complicated. I think mine is breaking apart. Have you had that happen?
I have had that happen before. Poly relationships are extremely complicated to make them work for long periods of time. How long have you been in this poly relationship?
My relationship has been going on for about 3 months now. It's still really new and we're just trying to work everything out and establish boundaries and such. What about your relationship?
Setting boundaries is the most important foundation in my opinion. Also, as much as you are comfortable communicating, you should be. My relationship has been going on for about a year. We have had our ups and downs as well. Nobody is perfect! I am very curios, when was the last time you went swimming naked?
A year!? Well, congrats to you then. That's incredible. The last time I went swimming naked? Hmm... About a week ago, actually. Nothing is more freeing and calming, honestly.
Thank you! Hey my hats off to you for having that kind of bravery. I still don't think I could bring myself to swim naked. What bet did you lose to make you go swimming naked for the first time?
Was born into it. In some ways I think we Amish folk have it easier than you English folks.  We refer to all outsiders as "English".
My partner and I made a bet about who could run the fastest mile. We were working out together one day and were just fooling around. Well, I lost the bet and had to swim naked later that night!
Haha that is a fun story to tell though! Those are the moments you will never forget. Hey, does your father still have connections for his door to door sales job he used to do? I could use a referral I am looking for work.
Absolutely. It's times that like make life worth living, right? And I'm not sure if my father still has those connections, but I'd be happy to ask him for you! I will be seeing him next weekend because it is his birthday.
Well happy birthday to him! How old will he be turning? Also, thank you for be willing to ask. I don't want to be a burden.
It's no problem at all, I assure you. He will be happy to help! I will be sure to text you as soon as I speak with him. He will be turning 65 this year. Can you believe it?
Wow good for him! Please tell him happy birthday for me and cheers to 65 years of a beautiful life! Going to law school on its own is already such an accomplishment. Does he ever talk about his time in law school?
Do the aliens visit you on the moon?
They visit me her often. Sometimes it gets a bit crowded so we send them away. Have you ever encountered an alien on your farm?
No, not directly, but my neighbor John thinks one of his cows was abducted. Do you have any aliens visiting you currently?
Really? I will have to ask around and see if I can get them to return John's cow. I know they can be expensive. No, not currently. I am traveling for work so I am not on the moon right now.
I envy your choice to live off the grid! No news, no technology? What language do you speak?
Thank! I'm sure John will appreciate it. Where are you traveling? If you are allowed to say. I know you CIA folk can be secretive.
If I share that with you, it could mean trouble for the both of us. Ask your father, I'm sure he recalls how secretive these operations can be. Speaking of which, how are the horses doing? I know that operation was stressful on them and the farm.
They are doing okay now, but one of them is actually pregnant! You have any experience with pregnant animals?
Oh wow! That is great news! I dont have any experience with pregnant horses. We dont have any horses on the moon because of the gravity situation. Are you still able to them in that condition?
How is your son doing today?
he is doing well, just doing what 8 year olds do
I definitely understand that, LOL. I bet he loves Disney channel just as much as me. Does he?
he does not seem to watch much TV. He is either on his phone or playing Fortnight on the computer
I Love playing fortnite too, hes my age so I definitely understand his appeal to it.
yea, it seems like all of you kids like that game. Are you going to visit Disney this year?
English of course, and a dialect of German known as Pennsylvania Dutch.  It's similar to real German.
Yes! I love to go to Disney and I cant wait to go to Splash Mountain again..however I might try some new rides too this time
we went to Disney last year. I posted some pictures on Facebook. You should check them out
I cant I dont use facebook at all but man you should send me the Disney pictures through phone, I'll show you my Mickey Mouse toy from Santa too
I do not know how to send over the phone. I need to get my son to do that for me
Oh , he might not know at that age. My parents , during the Disney trip, taught me a lot of how technology works.
yea kids always are better at learning technology that grownups
How many Limited Edition BMW did BMW make?
im not sure but guessing about 2000 or so
Are you going to any more conferences anytime soon?
no conrences for me! But let me tell you, your car sounds awesome, id like that in my collection
Were you able to sue Nascar for killing your dad?
Ha! You're being too nice. She doesn't have many miles on her but she's not all that special really. How many cars do you have in your collection?
are those true miles, has it already gone around once? i have 4 cars! and 2 motercycles!!
Those are true miles! I got her off the lot brand new with only a couple miles on her at the time. I bike to work to stay in shape so the car is only used on the weekends. Four cars?! Where do you keep them all?
I have a storage garage near the house, i love them all but exs[ecially my limited edition BMW
It's nice that's your storage garage is near your house. Do you take them out often or do you try to keep the miles down to a minimum?
I use them all, depends on my mood or where im going, i really need to lighten my load.
Makes sense. Nothing is quite as relaxing as getting out on the open road and just driving. What's been weighing so heavily on you?
Insurance cost! So far i dole out alot of money for no good reason and have never filed a claim. Thats why i need to sell some
I finally found a place to buy some good quality fresh seafood.
Awesome! What's the name of this place?
Between you and me yes... They failed to have the proper wall installed in the racetrack and they were at fault not him for spectating.
Uncle Petey's. Terrible name right? But the food is worth it.
LOL sometimes the worst names are the ones you can't forget! I'm guessing they're located near the coast?
Yeah. They ship it in very fast. Get's to my town 100 miles inland by the afternoon. Jealous of you being so close to the beach though
That's impressive. That means you will get the catch of the day the same day. Living close to the beach has its perks but also drawbacks
Really? What are the drawbacks? Maybe I need to rethink my dream house.
Well it all depends, right? Is it a vacation home or a place to retire? No drawbacks in there for sure. But when you're still far from retirement living in this area can get very expensive due to the influx of tourists
That makes sense now that I think about it. All a pipe-dream anyway. I'll be in my hometown till I die I'd bet.
You never know what the future holds! What's your favorite seafood by the way?
Tuna and Shrimp. Easily. Though it's hard to find great tuna close by to Alabama.
I bet it is. Tuna is pretty expensive too. I love yellowfin tuna, I believe that's something you might be able to find at Uncle Petey's
Good! They should definitely be held responsible. How is you mother feeling about it?
I heard a new song today that I think you would love!
Really!? What song is it and who is it by?
It's Peaches by Justin Bieber. Have you heard it?
I actually have heard that song! I first heard that song when Beiber performed it at the Jake Paul and Ben Askren fight. That is a good song. Do you enjoy modern music more than the old school stuff like New Kids on the Block?
I love New Kids on the Block but still enjoy listening to the new songs.  I actually don't like a lot of them. I think I am getting old.  How is your school going?
Nah you aren't getting old. You aren't old until you hit 60 in my opinion haha. My school is going well I have been able to keep my grades up. I actually plan on going kayaking soon during spring break to treat myself for my hard work.
That's wonderful! Keep up the good work! I are so close to being done.  I am sure kayaking and being outdoors will help you relieve some stress. You told me about kayaking before. I really need to try it.
I would love to take you kayaking with me sometime if you ever want to! You had mentioned you have never been camping before either. I'll make you a deal. I will be happy to take you into the outdoors for some adventures. In return, will you show me what a Lite Brite is and how to use it?
I would love that! We have a deal! I will bring Light Bright with me.  The activity is really relaxing and you can do it while camping.  I will have to talk to you before we go though. I have no idea what to pack with me.
Is lite brite something similar to crafting a piece of art? I could use some practice on my creativity I think. Before we go camping, give me a call and I'll help you go through my own personal checklist of what to pack!
My mother is sinking into a deep depression honestly. We both are very sad  and wish we never had to lose him. We aren't sure what to do next..
Light Bright is a very old toy, I think from the 60s. It includes pegs and a light box. You can be very creative and create a really fun art.
That is different from anything I have heard of before I can't wait to try it! Do you have a collection of lite brite art work you could show me sometime? I would love to see your masterpieces!
Do you know the genders of your triplets?
Yes, two boys and a girl. So I'm going to have my hands full!
I bet you will. Have you thought about potential names already?
Not so much. My husband and I can't agree. I tend to be traditional, and he wants something 'unique'. Do you think you'd like children some day?
'Unique' LOL. I feel bad some times for these kids with very 'cool' names. Go figure how uncomfortable it can get when they're young adults and looking for a job. I don't see myself as a mom to be honest
I agree exactly! Why not a strong reliable name that's been around forever. I think it's great that you know your heart when it comes to children. There's a lot of pressure, and not every woman needs to become a mother.
RIGHT? I agree with you on both counts. Being a mother is huge responsibility and I fully commend you for it. I feel I can do a better job as the cool auntie haha
That's amazing. Well I'm sure going to need a cool auntie or two once this lot is born! Plus you've got so many amazing hobbies. I wish I could play violin.
I'm not super into wrestling.
I'm so sorry. That happened with my mom when my dad died, too. I mostly just tried to keep her busy for a while. I'm not sure it really helped, though.
Funny you mention that. When my sister-in-law was in her last month of pregnancy she stayed at my place while I was just learning the violin. That meant I was playing it almost daily. Her son always smiles at me when he hears me playing even if he's only 2 years old
That's such a sweet story. You must have had some natural talent, as I imagine some of those early sounds are tough on the ears! One day I'd love to learn the cello It has such a deep mournful sounds.
I always joke that he smiles not because he remembers I played while he was still in the womb, but rather because I'm no longer hurting his ears LOL. Cello is nice, I have thought about learning it one day too
LOL! I suspect if you're skilled with violin and guitar, you won't have any difficulty picking up cello. Me on the other hand will be starting at zero.
I just got tickets to a Taylor Swift concert! Do you want to come?
Oh my gosh, yes!  I love Taylor Swift!  I especially like her Folklore and Lover albums.  Which albums of hers are your favorite(s)?
Oh my, I like her so much I would have a hard time picking one album.  She matured so much since her first album.  She never dissapoints. Have you seen her in concert before?
I have never seen her in person, but I've watched some televised concerts of hers.  I bet she puts on a great show; she always puts her all into her work.  Will you be incorporating any Taylor Swift music into your wedding?
For sure! I just can't decide on our first dance song. She has so many good ones. Which one would you recommend?
I've always loved her song Enchanted...Everything has Changed is a good one too...of course, Lover is a great first dance song as well...there's so many to choose from!
Yeah I think you have a really good idea there. We both need to occupy our minds for the time being and heal.. Maybe we could travel to one the countries she has always dreamed of seeing. Or maybe I could take her to an arcade and play games like she did when she was a kid.
That's why the choice is so hard.  Maybe I will listen to them with my fiancee and we will decide together.  How is your job?
Work has been going well, thanks for asking.  I really enjoy being able to help my students develop and foster a love of music.  How has your school year with the little kids been going?
I am so happy to hear that! I wish I could play instruments.  My work is great. I love working with younger kids.
I bet they have so much energy!  You must be exhausted by the end of the day!
I am but every day I feel really fulfilled.  It makes me feel so good to know that I have such big impact in their lives.  I would love to have kids myself one day. Do you have kids?
I do.  I have two boys; one is 11 and the other is 8.  They definitely have their moments where they fight, but they make me feel so happy and fulfilled.  I miss them being little babies...the time goes by so fast.
I had the worst customer come into my bar.
Oh, no! What were they like?
He was super rude and degrading, and when I told him the total of his bill, he refused to pay the full amount.
I hope you're able to kick people out when they're like that! I'm so sorry you had to deal with that. I had a situation like that last weekend at Billy Bobs.
Those sound like great ideas. I always say we can't control the bad things that happen to us, but we can try to bring good things into our lives.
Yes, the manager got involved and it was a whole situation. I do not get paid enough to deal with this nonsense. I cannot wait to get out of the bar industry, and become solely a customer. Uh oh, what happened at Billy Bobs?
But you're well on your way to becoming a nurse, right? Stay positive! So I was just minding my own business as usual. I go there to dance and forget about the week, but another person apparently came in to start fights. He kept saying the rudest things to people to get them riled up.
Yes, I honestly cannot wait to finish my nursing degree. I know I will be dealing with way more serious issues than cranky customers, but at least it is something I am passionate about. Plus, I will feel like I am making a difference. Wow, I hope you didn't get caught up in the middle of all that drama. Billy Bob's is always a good time but the crowd can be quite rowdy sometimes.
It's always better to be doing what you love, especially when it's helping other people. I haven't really been putting my chemistry degree to good use, so I'm considering going back to school myself. And yeah, the crowd can be rough but most people are just having a good time lol.
That's great to hear you are thinking of going back to school! What is your dream occupation?
I'm not really sure what path to take next. On one hand, I really want to just help people and make a difference. But on the other... I want to be making more money. Did you always know you wanted to be a nurse?
I think you should do whatever makes you happiest otherwise you will dread going in to work every day. I think I knew from a pretty young age. I was in and out of the hospital as a child and I looked up to and admired the nurses I saw there every day, they were so inspiring.
I think that's the biggest mystery of my life; I'm not sure what makes me happiest. My mother was a nurse and I was always inspired by her, but I was a bit scared of being at the hospital. It must have been tough for you to need to be in and out of the hospital.
Well, my computer time is up. Thanks for the volunteering suggestion, I will look into that during my computer time tomorrow.
That went fast! Are you looking forward to seeing you mom?
This is true thanks for keeping my spirits up. Speaking of family... did you have to throw any of your boys in your scorpion pit yet?
I am looking forward to seeing her. It's been a long time. She keeps suggesting I read some new books while I'm here, though.
I mean, it's good advice. It would be a great distraction if fiction, and you could learn some stuff if non-fiction. Helps to keep spirits up.
I wouldn't even know where to start with what to read. I just feel so tired and blah all the time, can you recommend anything maybe?
I'm not surprised you're feeling tired and blah. You're experiencing something incredibly stressful. I would start with thriller maybe, or suspense. Something easy to read but hooks you in.
That's a good idea, thanks!  How is working in the museum lately? Do you get to learn a lot?
As I give the tours, I already know most of the information so it can get a little repetitive. But I try not to let it show. I'm struggling with my partial deafness though. When people ask questions. It can get frustrating.
Gosh, I can imagine that makes it difficult at times. Does lip reading help with the lack of hearing?
It's challenging as it's usually a large group and sometimes I'm not fast enough to see who is asking the question. I've started sharing my issue with hearing, and people are generally kind. Hey, I was going to ask - do they have a library where you are?
We do, the books are a bit worn since they're donations, but we have a great selection!
I hope you really do take advantage of that resource. It should help pass the time, and before you know it, things will improve.
Oh, I've thought about it, believe me! Trouble is there's five of them and only one of me.
How did your time go volunteering at the homeless shelter?
It went well, but I always feel a little sad seeing all of those people in need. Especially with this snow we have been having, it's been a rough go for them. But it is definitely rewarding and helps me put things into perspective and realize that I am lucky for everything that I have.
What type of homeless shelter do you work at?
It's a local shelter for women and children escaping domestic violence. They come to us when they have nowhere else to go, but at least they are safe.
That is so nice of you to take time to care for those who don't have any other options. Maybe you can host a fundraiser for the shelter to raise some money to help those in need. You could do a pizza dinner for families and have little workout themed games for the children.
Wow, that is an amazing idea! I am not sure why I have never thought of something like that, but I think it could make a huge difference. Do you have experience in running fundraisers?
Unfortunately I have not hosted any fundraisers of my own, but being the social butterfly that I am, I have attended a bunch of them.
I have never really attended any myself so I am somewhat unfamiliar with the process. Maybe I can recruit you to help me out with it? I am not sure if you are interested in adding any volunteer work to your plate, so no pressure.
I would love to help, but I do have some traveling that I am going to be doing here in the next month, but if we plan for a day when I am available I would love to help.
I am sure we can work around your schedule, I really appreciate any assistance you are able to offer. Where are you traveling to?
Yeah how old are they now. Can you wrestle all five of them at once? If not you might want to hit the gym!
I am traveling through Europe. I absolutely love trying different foods, and what better place to go then to travel through all of Europe and trying all the different foods in the different countries.
Wow, that sounds incredible, I wish I could tag along! What countries will you be traveling through?
How is your favorite team performing this year?
They're going terribly haha. I can't bring myself to watch the games anymore!
Yeah, which team was that again? I completely forgot.
I'm a long time fan of the Chiefs. Family tradition! All my kids love them too. Even have a little jersey for the dogs in their team colors. Do you watch any sport?
Ahhh, the Chiefs! They've been slacking lately, and what a cute tradition! I'd love to see the doggies, and no I'm not much of a sports person myself.
Yeah you seem like someone of more refined tastes which is awesome. It's just important to have a hobby of any kind to keep us busy! I'm thinking of taking up music lessons.
Yeah life is so hectic with work, you should always find something to unwind with. I wouldn't go as far as to say they're refined but unfortunately sports doesn't do it for me. Music lessons would be fun, like what type of instrument?
Guitar! Yeah it gets crazy with work all week and kids on the weekend so it's nice to take time for ourselves. I know you  love classical music, can you play any instruments yourself?
They are 11, 9, 7, 5, and 2. I have given up any expectation that I can take them.
I play the violin! But I enjoy farming and things like that, our family isn't traditional by any means. My sister has an interesting job most of the family hates.
I remember, yeah. How is she going? Do you think she'll decide to switch careers? It must be hard for her to face a lot of judgment.
She's doing alright, I don't think she will. She finds it empowering and honestly I'm just happy for her because it's a lot of money and she doesn't mind doing it. More power to her.
Definitely! I mean honestly I wouldn't want my daughters doing that kind of work, but only because people would make it so hard for them... I'm glad your sister has you in her corner.
One of my dogs just chewed up a hat that I recently finished knitting.
That's very weird that your dog would do that. It probably didn't taste very good.
I am sure it didn't, but that dog will eat literally anything in sight. So now I have two problems; I have to take my dog to the vet, and I have to knit a new hat. I'm so annoyed!
My mom gets annoyed too when our dog chews up stuff. I try to move things with my mind up to high shelves, but sometimes I'm too slow.
What breed of dog do you have and what is its name? I am still so astounded to hear you can move things with your mind, that must be very useful.
Our dog is a Golden Lab. He's a service dog because I need help, and his name is Jerome. My mom hates that I can move things because sometimes chocolate disappears when she's not looking. She calls me sneaky.
Hahahah wow what a handful! You and the wife must be busy all of the time. I bet they are a blessing though!
Oh Golden labs are so cute, I would love to get our dogs together for a play date! You little power must make things very difficult for your mom sometimes haha. Have you pulled lots of pranks on people?
I really love to do pranks. My grandpa was wearing a hat when he came over and then he couldn't find it when he was leaving and it was on my head. Even though I didn't move!
Hahaha, that sounds so funny! What does your family think of all these pranks?
They get annoyed. When someone first see it, they think it's cool, but my mom says it 'quickly lost its charm'. Whatever that means!
I can see where your mom is coming from! Maybe you can put your powers to a good, and more productive use?
Maybe when I get more energy. With my heart transplant, I do a lot of sleeping. Stealing treats is the only fun I have.
I just found out I'm going to be a grandparent!
Wow congratulations! When are they due?
They are due to arrive in about 5 months. We are pretty excited.  When are your twins due?
How exciting!! My twins are due in 2 months, gonna be a busy beaver! You should teach your grandchildren how to play tennis!
I applied for a work at home job.
That's a great idea, but my arthritis sometimes keeps me off the court. They'll need someone like you for that haha. I bet your oldest is looking forward to being a big brother or sister?
Haha just send them my way and they'll be tennis stars! And yes my son is very excited, he's always wanted to be a big brother. Is it nice there? Hopefully you're able to get some outdoor time today!
Have plans to do a little gardening, if the rain holds. Need a place by the ocean. I could catch some warm rays. You ever surf while at the beach?
A beach day would be amazing right now, get a little tan and relaxation on! I surfed once when I was in Hawaii, absolutely loved it and can't wait to go back. Have you ever surfed?
Not with a board. Bodysurfing was my thing, no balance required. Does your dog enjoy running on the beach?
A buddy of mine brought over caviar for lunch earlier.
Wow lucky!! I'm drooling just thinking of it. I just had a smoothie for lunch... I'm on a juice cleanse again.
You must have expensive taste! I can't stand the taste of Caviar, what do you enjoy about it so much?!
Haha it's hard to explain. Just something about knowing how much it costs does it for me! Can't believe you use it for fishing! Seems like such a waste. Do you have any plans to go fishing this weekend?
Oh, we didn't use it for fishing! He ate it and tried to give me some which I denied, but yeah I absolutely love fishing! Unfortunately no time to fight this weekend, I'm currently in the army so I'll be real busy.
Oh yeah what kind of job is it? I heard data entry is easy to get into.
Ah that sucks you have to work weekends. I'm so lucky, my boyfriend takes care of everyting I need so I hardly have to work at all. Being in the army sounds awful.
It's not so bad, I work in the sanitation departments so it's kind of relaxed. Just a lot of work unfortunately. Must be nice not having to work though, I'm envious.
Yeah I'm truly blessed and I know it. What does the sanitation department actually involve? It sounds... messy lol.
It is very messy, it's basically just making sure EVERYTHING is sanitized. And I mean everything! So how's life in Hollywood? It must be prestigeous!
Yeah it's crazy! I just saw Reese Witherspoon walking down my street yesterday, I so wanted to run up and fangirl haha. There probably aren't too many celebs in the army.
No celebrities here, they're all by you! Wow, I'd have fangirled too, what does your boyfriend do?
He's a producer for Paramount! He said he's going to pull some strings and get me an audition next week, I'm so excited. That's why I'm on the juice clenase at the moment, gotta look my best.
What type of cuisine is your favorite?
African meal does it right for me
Is there a good restaurant near you?
Ah, now that makes sense.  I guess it's like an engineer that doesn't like to fix stuff around the house.  Well, work is work, I guess.
That sounds lovely. Name of the job?
yes there are few restaurant close by where I visit
I tried an Ethiopian restaurant once. I wasn't a big fan of the injera flatbread used to eat the food.
Oh really you might need to eat it with samosa. I have tried it with samsosa and very tasteful
I might try it again sometime. Are samosas one of your favorite foods?
Samosa is good with another meal than eating it alone
I like my samosas with a spicy vegetable filling. What do you like in your samosas?
I enjoy samsosa with chicken fillet with little veggie. invite me when you making some so i can come to eat
Sounds delicious. I'll will let oyu know the next time I make any. Does the restaurant near you serve good samosas?
Well if you come around we will check some other restaurant I eat out from
I was actually thinking of getting a watch to help keep track of my meditation hours. What would you recommend?
Hahah no I was trying to ask you where you applied to.  What kind of stay at home job are trying to get?
Ah great question! What kind of budget are you looking at?
I was hoping to keep it under $300.
Nice! There are heaps of budget watches I can recommend... will make a list and let you know! I just got back from work actually. Have you been busy since we last spoke? It's been crazy here.
Thank you so much. Can you add the fact that I want something a bit sleeker when looking?
Definitely! But I wouldn't have thought that was like you. You seem so practical and down to earth in your attitude to material things.
Again thank you, I haven't been to busy just avoiding bears. What has kept you busy?
It's sale season! So many customers. If it keeps up I might join you in the tundra haha. You'll have to teach me some bear avoidance tips.
Sure would! Safety is key. I figured you might be busy doing some shopping of your own.
I wish!! I figure it's all money in the bank so all this overtime just means a HUGE shopping spree for me at the end of it. How close is your nearest shop? I'd die if I was that far from a mall, lol.
There isn't much shopping options here. But maybe if you moved here you could be one of them! Watches shipped from the Tundra would be a novelty.
Oh, sorry. I am currently looking for a IT job. I see you like living green, favorite vegan dish?
Yeah bear themed watches maybe! Or you could make your own line of meditation watches. Does it get lonely?
You won't believe it! My eldest is dating a girl from his school. he just told me about it and I realized I have to handle this well or else he could break hearts! I know you wanted to know about the teens dating but this will be my first experience too. Will update you!
Oh my gosh good luck!! Keep me updated!! The thought of it scares me to death. It's awesome you have a relationship where he feels comfortable telling you.
I know! It really is such a blessing. How were you during those critical years? I was a mess!
My kiddos are still young so all that's in my future. Do you know the girl he's dating? Are you thinking of inviting her over and getting to know her as a family?
Of course, me and the husband might take them out to around the city one of these days. We love visiting places and maybe they'd enjoy coming along.
That sounds like an awesome idea! Hopefully she'll feel comfortable talking to you and you can make sure your son is treating her right! It must be intimidating to date one of your kids since your husband is a detective haha
It is, but I have some smart kids so their significant other is most likely just as smart! How far along are you in your pregnancy? Do you happen to know what gender it is yet?
Yes! I just went for my six months ultrasound and the tech confirmed it's a girl. We're thrilled. Can't believe it's only a couple months until she's here.
I'm so excited for you! Are you other kids male? You finally get the trifecta, haha. Hope it all goes soundly.
Well I never said I was vegan, I just try to grow and cook organic food. It is something I feel passionate about, do you know the health effects of the pesticides that commercial food producers use?
Thank you so much! We already have a son and a daughter so this little girl is just the cherry on top. Trying to stay healthy with heaps of walking, although I'll probably have to give up tennis soon.
Oh no, I've never played tennis. It's a shame but that's the conditions that come with having kids. Hope it all works out well and you have a pregnancy with litlte to no complications.
Thank you! Do you play any sports? Even though tennis is what I decided to go pro with, I love soccer and swimming as well.
How is school going? I bet you must be ready for spring break
School is going well. Yes I cant wait to have spring break so I can work full time. I bet that will be a busy period for you at the museum.
I'm glad to hear it's going well, but breaks are definitely always nice! And it'll for sure be busy. We get all kinds of interesting people during spring break lol. How are you settling in to the new place?
I know right! I am settling in well its a bit better than my former place
Do you have everything all decorated and moved in nicely? I wish I could send you some roses from my garden. They make great decoration.
Oh thats sound nice I will appreciate that will make it more colorful for me ... Thank you sending in big hug for that
Do you think you'll be visiting the museum during spring break?
Oh okay. I have no idea. Any specific vegetables you are growing?
I will pass for this year maybe next year I should take time to visit the museum
I hope you have lots of fun on your break
I doubt that thou. I wish I can come help you on your farm
I'm sure there will be lots of cool things to do! Stay positive and enjoy the time off.
I appreciate that you been awesome
I just got back from riding one of my horses.
Well, that makes for a wonderful morning outing. I haven't ridden today.
It was very enjoyable! When was the last time you went horseback riding?
About a week ago. I've been so busy with my plumping business. Seems like every tap around here is leaking. Do you ride often?
Everyday. The horses on the farm need to get their exercise. Do your kids like riding as well?
I enjoy an all natural simple chef salad fresh out of the garden. It sounds basic but you would not believe the difference in flavor that fresh organic garden vegetables make!
They do, but they're just learning to trot. Every time I take them, we go for ice cream afterwards. I'm not sure what they like more - the horses or the cones.
Ice cream sounds like a great treat. I might go get some myself. What flavors do you enjoy?
I'm kind of boring. Usually a good quality vanilla is my fave. My kids like those space color ones that stain their faces. What about you?
Salted Oreo. It sounds odd but it is amazing!
Oh, I'd probably like that. Here in the country there a little shop that sells the best salted caramel. After a big plumping job, I treat myself.
The farm might need some plumbing work soon. Do you work on older buildings?
Yes, all kinds of buildings. Not to brag, but I'm the best around here. Plus my prices are reasonable. Let me know if you'd like a quote.
I wish that your dreams come true in the nearing future.
Thank you for that! I've been working on many new designs for the catwalk... in my head lol. I'd love to make them real! And when I do your wife can model for me lol.
I'm sure she'd love to do that, she loves clothes but then again most women do. You should definitely try to do something with your fashion aspirations.
That sounds refreshing. Favorite vegetable to eat?
Have you convinced your wife to let you get a dog yet, or does she still really not like them? I don't know what I would do without my dogs. I've considered creating clothes for them...
She hates dogs and I've tried so many times to change her mind but Ithink she had a bad experience when she was younger back in Italy. I understand I suppose but it does frustrate me a bit.
Aw, I didn't know something bad happened to her. I can definitely understand that a bit more, but I hope she can heal from that and realize all dogs are different. On an unrelated note, I was curious to go out and try papaya after our chat since you love it so much... and wow! I love it!
It is so good for you. I love it. People say healthy foods aren't good for you but try papaya, pineapple and mango in a bowl and it's like heaven. Full of vitamins too.
I've always loved fruits, but for some reason I hadn't tried papaya. Healthy foods are the best! I do love baking and eating sweets, but I do my best to not overdo it.
It's so tempting to just eat bad foods, there is so much out there that it's hard to avoid it. I'm glad that you have finally tried it. It's not always easy to get hold of.
Most "bad" foods are fine in moderation, so that's something to consider if you have a craving every once in a while. Life is too short to avoid sweets forever!
I know but the older I get the more serious I'm taking my diet. I think the choices we make now stay with us for a long time.
That's definitely a good way to look at it. As much as I want to enjoy my youth, I don't want to be unwell in my old age. I don't like thinking about getting older because it makes me think about how my dogs won't be around forever.
Have you ever sung in front of people?  Like at church or in a concert?
I love most food honestly but I would say my favorite vegetable is spinach. I wouldn't mind opening a store selling my vegetables one day.
Haha no not adults! I sing to my kindergarten class all the time though, if that counts. But I save my Taylor Swift performances for the shower.
LOL. I like to sing in the shower too, mainly stuff I've heard in the radio really. You could try out for a talent show :)#
I think I would be too shy! But that's the dream. Have you ever done anything like that?
Not really. When I was younger I was part of a musical performance which was fun but I think standing in front of people on your own is a different story. I think I'd get stage fright!
Yeah same. It's different singing to a bunch of five year olds... they're so enthusiastic it's hard to get self-conscious. What do you do for work?
I'm currently studying to be a vet and work part time at a restaurant. I don't get much satisfaction from it but it pays the bills.
Nice! Yeah, you've got to do what you need to get by. That's so cool you're studying to be a vet! You must see a lot of wildlife in all your time outdoors.
Yeah all the time when I'm hiking in nature. There is so much to see and a lot of it is on your doorstep!
When you qualify as a vet you could even open some kind of nature sanctuary and help injured animals.
I think that would definitely be more rewarding than working on people's pets. I'd much prefer to be a vet that visits farms, helps livestock or yes, helps wild animals. I've always dreamed of visiting Africa. That would be so cool.
Great to hear. What work do you do from home?
Wow awesome! What an adventure that would be. I'd love to visit Africa someday. My dream trip is visiting Nashville though, and seeing some of my favorite country singers sing in person.
I know you want to move, have you thought about getting a place with a roommate?
The rent around here is so high, and I'm not sure my wages from Burger King would stretch that far. I have to do something though!
Maybe there are management positions you would qualify for or even look for a new job?
I might just try that. I doubt I'd qualify for management, but maybe a different job. Or I can go back to school. How do you find the motivation to work out?
My biggest motivator to start were my dogs. They always want to run and play, and I want them to be happy. I found the more I got out with them, the better I felt
Oh wow, that makes perfect sense. I've always wanted a dog, but my parents don't like fur or mess. I'm responsible enough, and maybe I should foster a rescue.
Fostering is a great idea! So many animals need love. Maybe seeing you take responsible for another creature will help your parents stop picking at you.
Yes, they nag at me a ton. And it makes me feel so awful, I end up eating Burger King after work. The weight gain is making me feel worse. A dog might help me make changes.
I'm sorry that you're feeling so awful.  Sounds like you definitely need a change of pace. I really enjoyed starting to exercise on a treadmill, do you have one available?
I have a job in an office but I do stay busy when I am home cooking, cleaning and gardening. You should come over and have a cook out with me sometime.
Not at home, my mother says she doesn't like the sound of machinery. But there's a gym next door to my work. I could try that on my break isn't of snacking.
That's a great idea, you might really like it. It makes me so happy to hear that you want to work on making yourself happier.
You are such a positive person. I can tell. Probably from hanging with your dogs and working out. Thank you for helping me.
How did you get started riding motorbikes?
My dad was an enthusiast! I guess I inherited it from him. He was such a rev head. It's funny how we pick up our parents hobbies.
That is true. My parents were artists in their own right which is why I'm studying it.
That's awesome! They must be so proud of you. What kind of artists are they? Would I know any of their work?
My mom was a photographer and my dad a painter. Part of why I go to Europe is to visit their gallery. Have you traveled to Spain?
No I've never been outside the US sadly :( That sounds so wonderful. Hopefully one day. Is your family of Spanish descent?
Yes, I have a very famous ancestor. You should make it a goal. I bet it would be fun to ride your motorcycle through out the Spanish Country side.
I got $50 worth of coupons for fresh fruit and vegetables.
I am considering retiring on my 85th birthday.
Oh of course, I forgot about your famous ancestor! Yes that sounds brilliant. What a dream. Do you do much traveling apart from Europe?
I try to travel as much as I can. Enjoy different types of art that you can only see when traveling.
Yes, not to mention all the exotic cuisine! I'm not very adventurous in that respect. Travelling more would definitely help!
No es cargo for you then hey? There are plenty or rice options or kebab shops across europe.
Haha yes! What's the strangest thing you've ever eaten?
Do you pray God to escape from these scorpions?
I surely pray to anything that will make them stop. What is your favorite folk music?
Bob Dylan is my favorite. He's really why I picked up my first guitar.
I really like Bob Dyla, Do you prefer his early or later phase of music?
I like his early stuff best. I have to admit that I love some down home country music too.
What made you want to retire ? Your Twitch fan will miss you.
So do I . I love picking the banjo to some good old hootenanny type country. Does your band do country?
We do a bit here and there. The banjo is so much fun to play.  I love that I get to be a musician.
Its better than the day time job! Does your husband like your music?
He does! He's a postal worker and I'm a custodian to actually pay the bills. Music is something we do to calm down and relax.
So you play together? How nice! I wish my CO was a musical type.
We do. It's a lot of fun and really helps us to stay bonded
I set a new personal best for my Olympic sport. I've just had details about where I'm going to be staying for the next few months. Training is going really well.
How nice! Whaere will you be staying?
I'm heading over to Hong Kong in this awesome new training facility! Bonus is it's really close to Japan where the next Olympics will be. Can't wait.
that sounds amazing! I love training, but you are at the next level. Have you seen my bee website?
Oh no. Don't worry. I meant my real job at school!
Yeah I checked it out after you mentioned it last time we spoke. It looks amazing. Did you get a professional graphic designer to make it?
My wife actually did the design. She is like you, is skittish about bees
Haha oh my gosh, she must be terrified living on a bee farm! But it's awesome she can help out like that. Does she still do any modelling?
yes, she is still in demand, really am proud of her. we train together, each to our own goal. Do you prefer to train with a group or alone?
I usually train solo as my sport is marathon running so I'm always going at my own pace. It can get lonely sometimes. I'm jealous, it would be great to have a training partner.
It keeps you honest, at least LOL. We usually celebrate with a papaya smoothie afterwards. How do you prepare your papaya?
I usually have it fresh, straight off the tree! I'm going to miss it when I'm living in Hong Kong, it might be harder to get them over there. Have you ever been overseas? Have you visited your wife's homeland?
I was in a different part of Italy, Germany as well. I have never been to the Asian countries. What is your home country?
How are the dogs and how is your pot farm going?
The dogs are sleeping right now. Pot farm is the bomb have you played it by any chance?
What retirement plans do you have, more streaming ?
No I haven't, I'll make sure to check it out. I usually play FromSoftware games.
You should I give it a try, it's a funny game where you harvest... drum roll... cannabis LOL. What type of games you like from them?
Hahaha sounds sophisticated. I love all their games to be honest, but my favorites are Sekiro and Bloodborne. Do you play other games? Is starcraft a game?
Sekiro, eh? I like that name... it sounds japanese, right? I don't play many games actually but I've indeed played StarCraft
Yeah Sekiro is Japanese, as are all the FromSoftware games. I don't play games all that much tbh. I mostly livestream philosophical discussions.
Gotcha, that's what I thought. Alright, you can't just say that and leave me like this... tell me more about that. Do you participate in philosophical discussions or are you mainly an spectator?
I participate in them quite often, I also organize debates on my twitch account. You watch twitch, maybe you've seen me on there. I'm quite big.
That's amazing. I do watch Twitch, what's your handle? I might have actually seen you already and if not will make sure to fix that LOL
@L0neWolf you should check it out. How's the dog walking business?
Will definitely give it a try. I certainly enjoy entering into never-ending philosophical debates hahaha. I definitely enjoy it I see it as a nice way to do exercise, play and make some dogs happy and being paid for it!
I live pretty frugally. Hence the Pinto. Probably just game more and enjoy my music.
How is the pregnancy going? Every day is closer to having those two wonderful girls.
I go day by day, all goood, save the cravings How would II fare eating only organic foods with my cravings?
It's not that hard. You can find them everywhere now. How do you like your house?
its a lot of work, but worth it. Do you own or rent?
I own. I like to grow my own organic vegetables. Do you have a garden?
I do! we grow all or own vegtables, canning or freezing for the whole year
I like to grow them and my girlfriend really like to can them. We post pictures on twitter all the time.
what are your favorites to plant and harvest?
Tomato's, spuds, corn and peppers. I also like to make my own kraut.
we do the same I built above ground beds,  and just finished a root cellar.
That would be great. What game do you stream these days ?
How long did that take to build? Seems like a great idea.
each takes a good day, if built to last. you can reallly control the soil
how is your new job going
It is going great, I'm really enjoying being able to help people - thank you for asking. I definitely have a lot to learn though - it is tough starting something new!
I would imagine so.  I am fortunate that I won the lottery 3 years ago and can just volunteer without worrying about a paid job.
Yes that definitely is lucky! Still probably things to learn in volunteering though. What kind of shelter do you volunteer at?
A shelter for homeless veterans.  Some of them just need a little lift to get back on their feet.
Wow, that is very important work. You probably hear a lot of very inspiring stories. It is fantastic that you are providing help how you can.
My dad was a veteran and so I feel a strong connection and urge to be helpful.  Would you be willing to do some pro bono work, perhaps just an hour a week at the shelter.  Your skills as a life coach would be really valuable.
Well, since I'm just getting started, I don't know if I'm the right person for regular work like that - but what if we set up a one time event where I could provide some information and then people could connect as they chose to do so - then see what it turns into?
Call of Duty is the main one. Maybe the new Madden in the fall. What's your favorite game?
That makes sense.  Let me talk to the shelter coordinator.  I am also starting a fitness program there.
Oh that will be very beneficial as well, I'm sure. Both great ideas. Thank you for connecting me - I'm happy to help.
It is very rewarding and I am sure you will get more out of it than you put in.  I know I have.
That is great to hear! I'm sure you're right. You're really making a huge difference, thank you!
Have you baked anything tasty recently? Have you managed to keep your dog out of your treats?
Yes, just made oatmeal raison cookies earlier today. do you like oatmeal cookies?
I love oatmeal cookies with chocolat chips! Is chocolate bad for dogs?
Yes it is. I make sure Ralph never gets to any. I'm working on knitting a pair mittens right now.
Mittens is my cats name! Are you using cat fur for them?
No, regular yarn. i have never heard of cat yarn.
I like Counter-Strike, I like to play and watch professional players. Do you like CS ?
Will your business be things you knit or things you bake?
Mostly things I bake. I may hang a few things on the wall to sell. Do you ever bake with your mom?
she gets those cookie dough rolls sometimes. they are really fun. Is that what you use?
No we make our own dough. Do you make your cookies into different shapes?
I like to make dog and cat shapes!
That sounds fun. Do you use a cookie cutter?
I found a rock gym and I'm curious to try it.
Oh, I think that's a great idea. I really enjoy rock climbing.
As you know, keeping up with farm duties can be a lot of exercise by itself. I have never tried an actual gym to workout but I am excited to start. Do you have any tips?
Go slow, start easy. It
That's a good one too. Been a while since I played though. Should I take it back up?
That's good advice. I wanted to start this week but my truck broke down. Do you think you can take a look at it for me? My grandfather gave it to me so I don't really trust anyone else with my truck.
Sure, I don't mind taking a look. Why don't you bring it over to my farm and you can meet Trooper too. He's such a sweet pup.
Thank you so much! I would love to meet your dog. I always wanted a pet but the sheep and other animals keep us so busy, we don't have much time for anything else. What is the best part about owning a dog?
They are fiercely loyal. When I was just a child, Trooper saved my life. They really love their people.
I remember you telling me about that. That is the main reason I've been considering getting a dog. My parents are getting older and I think it would be a good idea to have one to protect the house.
I can understand that. A dog might be a great companion for them, especially if they spend a lot of time at home.
What breed would you recommend getting?
Great Dane's are wonderful because they're so lazy and calm, but they also need a LOT of food. Black labs are wonderful family pets and do great on a farm.
Just been to the shops to pick up a whole bunch of fruit and veg, this diet is tough!
All diets are difficult, I believe you can do it though! What types of fruits did you get?
It is getting long in the tooth. New games are more popular, it will only get les and less popular. I would choose indie games, like loop hero, they will attract more viewers.
I bought some strawberries kiwis bananas and some pears. how about you have you ever been on a diet?
I did start somewhat of a diet when I got pregnant.  I don't know if diet is really the right word for it, but I've been actively trying to eat healthier for my baby.  I agree it's been hard, especially when I have cravings for sweets.
haha i understand i bet its hard my wife craved gerkins when she was pregnant do you have any kind of weird cravings?
Yep I get them all the time! Some of the weirdest ones were oysters, and also corned beef.  Luckily my husband has been great about taking care of me.
oh i cant stand oysters or any sort of sea food for that matter and its good you have your husband keeping care of you how long have you been pregnant
I'm a few days short of 5 months and already I can't wait for the little bug to be out of there.  How are your kids doing?
so not long to go then and they are very good thank you what documentaries have you been watching?
The last one that I really liked was The Social Dilemma.  Have you ever seen it?
My children came to visit and that made me alot happier than I've been.
That is wonderful. Children can make you so happy. How far do they live?
That's awesome! How did you manage to score that?
Interesting. You think it's because I'd be one of the few channels to chose from?
They're only about 40 minutes from my house, but that still seems to be far enough that I don't seem that often.  It was really great that they made the trip to see me.
That is wonderful. What did you do with them? I always ride horses with my kids.
We just hung out and had dinner together.  It was nice just being able to chat with them and catch up.  I wish I had the means to do something more fun with them like horseback riding.  Do you keep your horses on your own land?
Yes, for now I do. I am thinking of moving to the city. If I do that I will have to put them at a nearby ranch.
Interesting, why are you thinking of moving?  I would think being in the country would be way more peaceful and relaxing than the city.
I want to be a lawyer, and there just aren't that many jobs available in the country. I will have amuch better chance of getting a job there.
Yeah that makes sense, you could always commute to your job though, right?  I think I know a few people at my work that drive in from the country.
I would rather move to the city. I really don't want to have a long drive. I can just take a taxi.
I understand that, I can see not wanting the daily drive.  And on a lawyer's salary you shouldn't have a problem finding a nice place close to where you work.  Have you started looking at jobs yet?
Not yet. I am still busy with my horses. I think in a few months I'll get started.
Yeah, there are many CS streamers it will be difficult to differentiate you from them.
I have been enjoying driving my new car.  I am thinking about getting a cat.
I highly recommend you getting a cat! They are great companions, are you thinking of a kitten or a grown cat?
I am thinking an older cat, as they are harder for shelters to rehome and adopting from a shelter is important to me. Do you have recommendations on shelters I should consider?
If there is a kill shelter in your area I would recommend that you might very well be saving a cats life.
I'll look into that. I have adopted both of my cats, but neither from a shelter. One was an unwanted kitten and the other's owner was 92 and couldn't care for him anymore. How did you come to be guardian of your cats? Tell me the story!
I have always loved cats, I got my first cat when I was six. His name was Elmer Fudd.  I have always been partial to orange cats, but really just cats in general.  I know that black cats rarely get adopted because people are suspicious of them.  I always like to pick the ugly cat or the under dog because they have less chance of being adopted.
Elmer Fudd is such a good name! My cats are Tag and Henry. Tag is the first cat I've ever had, and he is now 10. Henry is 11. Henry's owner was so scared to put him in a shelter (he was 9 at the time) because she thought nobody would adopt him. I'm so grateful he's mine now! He's awesome.  Like your cats, he loves watching birds -- we sit on our screen porch and do that. Do your cats go outside? Or watch from windows?
My cats go in and out all day long, they are quite spoiled it seems like I am always getting up to let them in and out.  Luckily they don't catch birds only watch them.  I have moles in the yard and I wish they would catch those but they don't seem to be interests.  Do your cats like to ride in your new car?
You have sweet, gentle kitties! Henry has caught two mice but otherwise my boys aren't hunters either. The car has been great, but it makes me miss my old car's gas mileage. I used to drive a Prius and I miss that car more than I like the volvo!
Why did you trade in the Prius?
I'm thinking about buying a truck.
The cats hate the car, unfortunately. I think it makes them nauseous. It's a bummber because I live 8 hours from family, and so traveling to see them is important and I wish the cats didn't hate it so much! Do yours enjoy the car?
Mine don't like the car either, the minute i put them in the kennel they scream.  I once had a cat that did like cars, but it ended up being a bad thing because he later got run over by a neighbors car because he wasn't afraid of cars.
I had a few days off recently so decided to go on a fishing weekend, I managed to catch five trout!
That's great! What a fun start to spring. I used to go fishing with my dad. I know you're a good cook -- do you like to cook the fish you catch?
I always eat what I catch.  I made a great pecan crusted trout in the oven.  I found the recipe on the internet. What's your favorite recipe site?
That sounds so delicious. I love seafood myself. I love Bon Appetit and Epicurious! Do you have a favorite?
I think that All Recipes has the most simple recipes to follow.  I don't like when a recipe gets very involved.
Me either. Or when they go on forever with their life story before giving the recipe! Takes away from time spent, yanno, actually eating or doing other things. Like being outside, or reading, or whatever. You have such a variety of hobbies -- indoors and outdoors both. What's your favorite hobby? Fishing? Comics?
I think my favorite hobby would be fishing, I just love being outdoors.  What about you? Do you like to be outdoors?
I do! I love hiking and camping, and I'm a runner. We live in a really outdoorsy area where I am, and the sunshine lasts til after 930 PM even in April, so there's plenty of outside-ing to do here. :-) While I don't fish, I do love being on the water. We are near Lake Michigan so we are almost always at the beach. I want to buy a boat! Do you have a boat?
What kind of truck are you interested in buying, or have you been considering several from different brands?
That sounds great.  I know there are a lot of lakes in  your area.  I have a small fishing boat and also a fishing kayak.  Boats can be a lot of trouble, you have to maintain them frequently, but it is nice to be able to get out on the water.  When you run are you training for a race, or just running for the fun of it?
Yeah, they're a ton of work - that's what my wife keeps telling me whenever I tell her I want one. :-) I used to constantly train for races, but life got in the way for awhile and I stopped. I've sent about the last six months getting back into race-shape (I'm not all that fast but just trying to not get injured), and I think I'm about ready to start signing up for things! There's a half marathon in Detroit I have my eye on. My favorite race I've done though was at Asbury Park beach in Jersey -- the ocean was beautiful! Do you walk/run/hike or anything like that ?
I like to run but  mostly just do it to get exercise and burn some of my dogs energy.  I have done a few 5k's to raise money for charities, but a marathon seems very daunting to me.
Running with a pet is so fun! I used to run with one of my childhood dogs. 5K is a great and fun distance; I like 10Ks too. I don't know if I'd ever run a marathon -- I'm not fast enough to do those long training runs regularly! It's like 4 hours of running every Sunday to do a long run, haha. I prefer shorter stuff that I can do more consistently. I like training for a half marathon but only because it gives me a longterm goal. Most people I know who run marathons really do a number on their bodies training. Doesn't seem good to me. However, marathon runners get to be marathon eaters so that's a plus! You like to cook, right? Can you recommend any good sweet potato dishes for carb loading?
I've just been to the skate park with my friends, would love a black olive pizza right now!
hey you need to get out more and go see some live concerts
Oh yeah? Do you have any specific musicians in mind? I have been to an Indie music concert recently
indie musib is my favorite, just saw minus the bear and met the whole band who signed an album
Wow great. You must have spent a fortune for the VIP tickets. Were there many people at the venue?
small venue, under 500, thats what makes it so fun and personal
I currently have a Dodge Ram 1500 but am thinking of getting a Ford F150. Do you have any info on trucks that you could help me with?
That sounds great. My concert a year ago was actually at a large stadium. Almost 10,000 people capacity. Couldn't see much what was going on on the stage haha
either way, just adds to the memories, life is to short, but when in doubt eat black olive pizza! hey just might take up skateboarding!
Yeah nothing can go wrong with black olive pizza. If you are not busy this weekend, what do you say we grab some beer and pizza
ok, sounds good, you come to ohio often?
I do visit Ohio once a while cuz my cousin lives there. Or you could come to Illinois sometime I know how you want to visit Chicago
id like that, but theres a local indie band playing here next weekend at the pub, youll love this band, called circle jerks!!!
I have found some new books in English. Once you have learned to read more, you should check them out.
Thanks. what are the books about?
One of the books is about a Jamaican woman going through the ups and downs of her life, it's called Queenie.
That sounds interesting. what about the other books?
Of course, I drive a Ford F150 myself and I would highly recommend it. It has good hauling power and a very powerful engine. In any case, try getting a truck with 4WD if you can.
Another one is called Rich Dad Poor Dad, it teaches us new things about money we may have never knew.
That sounds like a good one to read. I am definitely interested in learning more about money. that wasn't something I really had to know about growing up.
It really is, when you feel confident enough to read you should get that book.
Do you have any other books you think I should read that would be beneficial?
The 7 habits of highly effective wisdom. I know that it might not sound interesting, but you can learn a lot from it.
well wisdom is definitely a good thing to learn to have.
It definitely is, no matter how old or young you are.
what are the books you were looking for in Spain?
I won a wrestling tournament title belt.
Thats great! How many tournaments have you been it?
That's what I have now and I tow a little bit so it would be helpful to continue that. Do you use your truck on the farm a lot?
I have been in 10 tourneys. It's a very fun career.
It seems a little dangerous as well, have you ever been hurt?
I've had two torn ACLs, and a broken arm. I really interested to hear about your career. What do you sell?
I'm actually a home maker but I wanted to follow in my fathers foot steps as a door to door salesman but I never did.  He sold Kirby vacuums for over 25 years.
That's pretty cool. I remember the door-to-door salesmen very well. I just got rid of a set of encyclopedias that mother and father bought from a door-to-door salesman! How is the hiking going? Have you done any interesting trails lately?
I went on a hike at a local state park a few weeks ago.  It was great, but it seems like a lot of snakes are out lately!  How are your workouts going lately, do you do them at a gym?
I do most of them at a local gym, but some at home too. It's a full-time commitment considering the field I'm in.
That makes sense! I've seen a lot of people doing more workouts at local parks.  I volunteered last week for a clean up hike at our local park.  We collected 50 bags of trash!
Wow. It's crazy how may litter-bugs we have. How often do you volunteer?
I try to volunteer at least once a month.  How about you?  Where do you volunteer?
Definitely, it is a must have if you work on the farm. I use it to transport farming material, sometimes even livestock if other transport vehicles are occupied.
I looked up the Disney races, I may try one soon.  I am going to a piano bar tonight, have you ever been to one?
Once. I went to one with a few out of town friends a few years back. It was a lot of fun. Do you go often?
As much as i can go. I feel like i can learn a lot from other piano players.
That's a solid plan. Perhaps you could ask for some tips or maybe even see if they'll let you play a song or two?
I definitely ask for a lot of tips. I never thought about asking them if i could play though. That would really be a dream come true.
Never hurts to ask. And the experience of playing in front of an audience could be valuable.
You are definitely correct. No wonder you are a life coach! You definitely put a good idea in my head and motivated me!
Good! I'm glad I was able to help. That's what makes me enjoy my job so much.
I can definitely understand that. Did you have this kind of a passion before you needed chemotherapy, or did it only happen after that?
After. While going through all of that I got to see lots of good people doing everything they could to help others. It inspired me to want to help others as well.
Wow, Ford's must be one tough truck! I am not positive I would transport livestock in my Dodge...
That is really inspiring to hear. I know it is an awful thing that you had to go through. However, sometimes life because that much more meaningful after such a horrible event.
Definitely. Few things can open your eyes to new things and perspectives reminders of the fragility of life. Each new day is another joy to experience after thinking, for a time, that you wouldn't have many more.
Would you every consider violin as a profession?  What is your favorite outdoor place to visit and which new place to you plan to visit next?
woah there. Slow down cowboy. One question at a time.
Okay. Ever thought about playing violin professionally like your dad?
I have, but, as much as I hate to say it, I'm not sure I
I'd love to hear you play. What instruments do you play besides violin and piano?
Sorry about that. Fat Thumbs. LOL      I've dabbled in so many. Clarinet, oboe, sax, upright bass, marimba. You play anything?
No, I wish I did. I really like violin but never took lessons. My garden takes most of my free time. Do you garden at all?
I don't. It takes forever to clean my hands after, and if I start getting dirt on my instruments it's a major problem. What are you growing this year?
I'm sure you could, however I always recommend using a more specialized vehicle if you can. Are you particularly interested in having a truck with more bed space or a bigger cabin?
Lots and lots of flowers! Planning flower beds is a fun challenge and it's great to be outdoors. Do you like hiking? That's one of my favorite hobbies.
I love it. Got a nice hike planned for tomorrow in fact.
Ooh! Tell me about this hike!
Highland Park. They've got maybe 20 miles of trails. Far enough from the city that it's nice and empty and I can just relax in peace.
Once I figure out what I want to do in life, maybe I will become famous to as I like to make money.
Being famous isn't always as great as it sounds Haha!
Well as long I make a lot of money, I can accept the hardships of being famous, lol
Ha, maybe but remember there's more important things than money. Happiness should always be your priority! And trust me with fame, happiness is sometimes very hard to find!
I understand that, I do not see my self becoming famous so I do not worry about it. I try to do what makes me happy
Well that's the main thing! Have you had any more thoughts about what you want to do in college yet?
I joined a couponing group and won a raffle, it will really help out. How has work been lately?
A bigger cabin, I think... What would you recommend? I don't do a ton of transport so I think the cab would be more beneficial.
not really, I am not technical or have any great skills. I may study business. I would like to own a business one of these days.
That could be a good idea, studying business can give you a lot of different options as well!
That is why I like it, It is like "general studies" but with more of a focus
Yeah good point. How's your job at Burger King going?
I got flipping burgers down to a science, lol
Haha, I'll have to order some when your next working, as long as you give me extra fries, haha!
Trooper and I went on a hike and the most interesting thing happened!
oh that sounds interesting what happened?
I saw three baby owls! they were beautiful!
that is pretty cool i have never seen an owl what colour was they
If you don't transport often, a bigger bed isn't really necessary. Its usually better to have a bigger cabin, so more people can be in the car. I know it would be great if more people could carpool with me as I drive my truck.
light brown. so cute! speaking of cute -- tell me about your dogs!
they are so energetic were always going on long walks but never really see much wildlife such as owls do you have any other hobbies
nothing like a nice dog walk :-) I'm out in colorado so I hike a lot and rock climb. anything to be outside. do you hike?
oh yeah i bet the weater is amazing for hikes and no not really like i said i enjoy biking so im rather on the large side haha
biking is fun too! one way to burn off that baking :-) what's your favorite thing to bake?
I do enjoy niking on nice days and i love baking different cakes like red velvet and carrot cake
oooh I love red velvet cake with cream cheese icing! do you bake from recipes or do you just sort of know what to do?
a bit of both really the more and more i bake a certain thing i start to remember and when im confiedent i will start experimenting have you ever baked?
How is your pet fish doing?
My fish is doing great, I feel happy too as I got it for my new wife as soon as we got hitched and married.
That would be nice. My gas mileage isn't great. I wish I could carpool so it wasn't so wasteful.
Oh wow. Just like that? But you are so young! When I was your age, I wanted to see the world so I decided to travel!
Yah, my parents find it weird but ever since listenting to Elvis Presley I realized what love truly is.. and I found it. What do you live to do while traveling?
I worked from place to place while traveling. Like at the youth hostel and such. When I was in Mexico, I was actually a missionary. In England, I joined a soccer group and worked as an assistant coach
Speaking of coaching I use to have a coach for my hiking club, we would run miles on those sunny days. I remember it like it was yesterday. Since I love all types of music, we would play different genres every mile of distance we would hike
Oh cool! I see you have been very active outdoor as well. Still doing outdoor stuff? I enjoy hiking on the weekend. Sometimes camping too!
Yah I love to do outside stuff, it is kinda embarrasing as I wear an orange wig to protect my natural hear from all the hard sweating. Camping would definitely help my orange wig not mess up so much since its more sedentary than hiking.
Great! Well just so you know my favorite color is red haha! Recently, I started going to church more often and I found true passion in religion. So I do outdoor stuff less and less
Your favorite color is red! Thats so interesting because I have a implement carrier tractor that I use for recreational purposes. What do you do at church choir?  Have you ever sung Elvis Presley?
Oh well. I love Elvis Presley but we don't really sing Elvis Presley in church. Mostly gospel music haha! You should come to church with me sometime!
Will they allow my orange wig in Church? Ha it seems kind of un-religious to have a modification to my body like that
MPG is another thing to consider for trucks as well, although more modern trucks are much more efficient than older models. Still, they end up being more fuel inefficient than say a sedan or even a coupe.
So, how are you and the wife enjoying married life?
we love it. But I guess all newly married couple love it at first, :)
I love it still, even after many years! does your wife work on the farm with you?
No, she is a teacher. Plus she is from the city and knows nothing about a farm
I grew up in the city and moving to a more rural place was crazy for me, especially as a student. I had no idea how much work went into maintaining a home!
I can see were it is difficult at first. You basically have to work 24 hours taking care of the animals. But I grew up doing it so it is second nature to me
that must be so rewarding though, to work with animals and land like that. which part of it is your favorite?
the animals, nothing beats seeing a fowl being born and watching it grow up. I imagine it is like having kids.
that's so awesome. do you raise/care for the animals all their lives? sell them? what type of farm is it?
we have chickens running around and a few cows but we mostly have horses which we do sell
Been to any good clubs lately?
that's amazing. my wife grew up in kentucky so she loves horses because of derby! today is derby day. do you watch the races?
wow, I did not realized that it was Derby day. I think they did not have one last year?
I rode one of my horses for the first time!  He seemed a bit hesitant to let me ride him, but eventually he warmed up to it and walked around my property without misbehaving.  It was a nice bonding experience for us.
It sounds fun, I am sort of scared of horses.
They're really sweet when you get to know them. Do you ever watch the Kentucky Derby horse race? It is held once a year and it is today!
I'll watch it when I come across it on TV. But I did not realized it was on today. I'll try to watch it if I feel well enough.
I'm so sorry you're under the weather. Do you know what's making you sick?
It is not that I am sick, it is my family life getting me down
You must be feeling stressed about the divorce. Do you wanna talk about it?
nothing much I could say, we just decide it was best to get a divorce.
Not really. The clubs just haven't been the same recently. I would like them to come back but it's been tough.
I got divorced in my late 20s -- it was hard, but it led to me finding my wife whom I'm married to now! I know it probably feels like there's no end in sight, but you'll come out on the other side of it. Tell me something you feel hopeful or positive about? Might help you feel better
The only thing positive is my job as a car salesman. I like meeting different people and making them happy with a new car.
nothing like a good vehicle! I use my truck for everything. it feels like a family member! what type of cars do you sell?
We are a Chevrolet dealership. You need a new truck?
I just watched the documentary My Octopus Teacher it is a nature documentary. Have you seen it?
No I have not seen it, but I love documentaries is it good?
It is definitely more interesting than I thought it would be. What other documentaries would you recommend for me to check out next?
I think you should watch college admissions
Is that a documentary? Do you know any good food related ones?
Yes, its a documentary. I usually watch vegetarian documentaries, Food Inc is good
Yes. Thank god for the vaccine though. Things should be back to normal soon.
I have seen that it really bummed me out. Maybe I just want to watch a cooking show to get inspired. With such a culinary family do you watch shows like that?
Yes I really liked that show!
I think I might watch top chef. Get some ideas for next weeks shopping
That is a good show? What are you thinking of making?
I like it. I think I might make some kind of Mexican meal for cinco de mayho.
That sounds good, I will probably go the beach for cinco de mayo
How are the furbabies? I would be interested in sending a cash donation towards your charity work. Would this be ok?
The furbabies are doing great, as energetic as ever! That would be amazing, we focus on helping the less fortunate in the community.
Great! I just took my dogs for a quick walk. What does your charity do to help the less fortunate?
What breed of dog do you have? We take over abandoned buildings to turn them into public housing, specifically targeted in at-risk communities. Have you volunteered anywhere lately?
Yeah. Even the bookstore I work at is being hit pretty hard. People just are going out as much as I thought they would be at this time.
They are mini Australian shepherds. That is amazing. I have been volunteering at my local animal shelter. Taking their dogs for walks with my own.
How precious! It seems you really love dogs, do you work somewhere that involves dogs or animals?
I do not.I just love animals so much I spend my spare time with them.  I work at a tech start up
I am with you there, I also love animals and try to spend a lot of time with them. What kind of tech start up? That sounds interesting.
A software company. It can be intersting but definitely has that young feel which I love.
It sounds like it would be intriguing and exciting working for a tech start-up, especially in today's age. I can understand the young feel to it.
It definitely isn't the old office feel which I love. You are free to be you instead fo a suit.
That is so important, especially now. I'm glad you found a job that allows for a "new" feeling, and especially glad you have escaped the traditional office life!
Do you have any upcoming travel plans coming up?
Yes, i am actually going to Europe for a few weeks. I have been missing my extended family out there, so i am going to take advantage of vacation and see them all.
I can imagine. Business must be really slow. How is the store holding up?
That's good, besides seeing your family do you have any ideas of what you're going to do in Europe?
I have been to Spain before, so i will just go there to visit with family. I plan on doing the Euro railing. A lot of my European family has already done it in their lives. Now it is defintely my turn. Going from city to city and country to country by train, and seeing all the sights and enjoy all the local cuisines.
That sound fun! I would love to do that one day. You have to tell me how it went after you get back.
I will definitely tell you all about it! I will make sure to eat one cheeseburger in each country, so i can tell you which country has the best ones! Haha
That would be amazing if you do, so I can try different types of food until I get to the country with the best cheeseburger.
I will definitely do that for you! Do you think you would go with your close friends traveling, or with your family?
Thanks so much! And I'm definitely taking my close friends, but if my sister or cousin wants to come whenever I decide to do this trip then they can.
That is fantastic! Maybe I could meet you in some of my favorite countries while you are out there, so i can show you guys around the places that i am going to now!
Yes we should meet up. Our little group would probably get lost somewhere if it's not for you or some tour guide showing us around.
It will be a lot of fun! You can definitely count me in!
OK. It's a dying business model since Amazon came along but as far as independent bookstores go, it is holding on.
Have you decided to come over
Yes, I  need company a lot. Ever since i was retired I havent seen many coworkers so I will decide to come over . Maybe I can grill for yall and give yall some southern taste!
Sounds great! I can pick up some supplies from the grocery store. Anything you'd like?
Pick up some dice so I can gamble after this.. if the most fun thing to do with this much inheritance and money garnered over the past few years., Ill teach you how t do that too
Sounds like fun. Do you go to some place locally to gamble or is there somewhere out of state you travel to regularly?
I always come South for the winte So I do it in a place that is near the southern border. Like South Carolina, Florida, or even texas
I hear there are some big casinos in Oklahoma near the border. Have you ever gone to one of those?
Yes, all the time. Oklahoma has nice grass so I cut the grass there too for side hustle money and to get some sun after being retired.  But yah, gambling in their casinos is definitely so fun.
How often do you go to the casinos? I don't know much about gambling so I'd worry about losing too much money.
I go every other month to gamble all my retired checks. I also love to see the people there as it gives me a refresher of how life and being active is.
I should do the same! Work is just as bad as ever. I dropped another baby and received a pay penalty because of it. It's going to be a tough month.
Yes, as dominant as Amazon has been, gotta be thankful that some people still prefer the experience of physically browsing for items.
It does sound like a good way to meet a lot of people from different walks of life. You must have met a lot of interesting people along the way.
Yes, especially in the south. Everyone is just so much more socialable and fun compared to the north or the west. I treally is a true experience. You should start gambling too, just put a small amount of money in it and it will work
I went to the gym and did a lot of rowing that my arms are sore.
That must of been a good workout you did. What are you going to eat to fuel your body?
Literally anything, I eat when I am bored, and after that treadmill sessoion really allowed me to eat some pizza from papa johns. I will be ordering it tonight haha.
I guess you need to gain back all those calories you burned. What type of pizza you're getting?
I might eat some pepperoni pizza for the extra meat , It depends how I feel as I still have an extra gym session to go to .
Wow I thought you were done with the gym for today.
Lol no, I love the gym and I love going there. I practically live in there at this point
Well I can understand that. If I have nothing to do all day, I would just keep painting until I realize what time it is.
Yeah, I read my Kindle but I really do prefer to have a hard copy. I usually only read on my kindle when I am at the gym or traveling.
Painting? I dabble into it sometimes. Have you ever thought to be an artist or art teacher? I heard they make good money and also have good quality jobs
Yea, I want to become an art teacher and maybe sell some paintings on the side.
Do you have any other hobbies that you cant stand to live without? Similar to how I cant stand to live without the gym
I like to cook and travel to different places.
I taught my dogs a new trick today.
That is great? What was it? I wish my parents would get me a dog.
I thought them both how to roll over. They learnt the trick so quickly
What kind are they? My family has a german shepard but I want a dog of my own you know?
I have a Boxer and a pug
That is a fun mix. Do they go to the park with you?
That's interesting. I still prefer a hard copy, expecially when it's an important writing.
I try to go every morning before I head off to school. Mornings can get busy with teaching and I sometimes have to get someone else to do it
I went to the park twice today. I love weekends because we have no school and I can still see my friends. I think we are going to watch Frozen again tonight too! It's a great night for me.
That sounds like fun! I love Frozen. Most of my weekend will probably be taken up with grading homework, taking the dogs out for walks and maybe if I'm lucky I'll get to play Clue.
It is supposed to rain tomorrow so we are going to have a board game competition
What board game are you going to play? Scrabble, Stratego, Risk and Clue are my "go to" games for rainy days
I like playing candyland most. Scrabble is hard but my parents let me use my spelling lists.
I have been working on recording a new song.
That sounds pretty awesome. What kind of music do you record?
I LIKE THE FOLF MUSIC, SOMETHING IN A BALLARD FORM LIKE BOB DYLAN ABOUT BUTTERFLIES
WOW THAT SOUNDS AMAZING. I LIKE TO LISTEN TO MUSIC AT MY FAVORITE MEXICAN PLACE
Do you have a favorite genre of books that you like to read? I like historical biographies and self-help books.
I LOVE MEXICAN TOO, SO FEASTIVE NO MATTER WHAT DAY BUT CYNCO DEMIO MY FAVORITE TIME
Yes, Cinco De Mayo is quite fun. My favorite Mexican restaurant also plays all the NASCAR races on their big screen televisions. It's so nice.
MY LOCAL REASURANT HAS NASCAR ON SUNDAYS WHILE EVERYONE ENJOYS MAGERITIAS
That sounds like a lot of fun. Do you often attend?
EVERY SUNDAY JUST FOR NASCAR AND DRINKS, LOVIN DOME TACOS ABOUT NOW!
It does sound like you enjoy it very much, you've yelled about it the whole time.  You must be very passionate about Mexican food.
THE CROWDS THE BEST, PEOPLE SO FRIENDLY EVEN 15 YEAR OLDER GET INTO IT
I'd love to attend a great weekend race day. Unfortunately I work weekends so I often cannot go.
What kind of things have you been growing in your garden? Does your father garden with you?
I'm growing tomatos and bell peppers.   They work great in  most recipes.  You should take a cooking class to get used to making for  other people
I mostly read books on Stocks/Daytrading.
Ooh tomatoes and peppers, there's nothing better than a homegrown tomato. A cooking class does sound like a fun idea, I'm sure I can find one somewhere in the city. Have you ever taken one?
No but my dad is a great cook and I've learned from him.  Maybe I could be your chef on your yacht
That would be fun, I do love to eat. How is your job going are you still working at the convenience store?
Yes, I kind of like it. I get to see so many people.  It makes the day go by fast.  Do you have any upcoming travel plans
That's great always good to do something you enjoy for work. Yes I was thinking of going to Italy soon. For the food if nothing else haha.
That would be an amazing trip.  I would love to travel to europe some day.
It's a beautiful country I've gone twice already, you definitely should do it at some point.
I will put it on my bucket list, first I would like to travel across the US, maybe I will stop in seattle!
Seattle is a great city, if you stop by I'll show you my yacht!
Sounds like a plan, maybe I can give you a quick cooking lesson
Nice, I like personal finance too! I want to read JL Collins's book but haven't found a copy yet.
The next time around I would like to join so that I can try writing poetry.
Absolutely!  My creative writing class has no limits with what we want to write about, as long as it's original.  How long have you been writing poetry?
Its been years I started writing and I like to play football as well
For class, are you looking to share or are wanting feed back ?
Nothing I am just sharing. What would you like to do when you are alone?
Cooking keeps me busy most of the time.  When I can, I'll go fishing.  I just started the writing class because I'm hoping to maybe write my own comic book one day.  Still waiting to see if I have what it takes.  Are you still playing for a division or just for fun now?
Yes I am still on it and it is very interesting. DO you like it?
I'm more of a sit back and watch some college football fan myself.  Would love to play but I can't take a chance of hurting my hand.  Bump hand means I can't work.  How long have you been playing?
I have been playing this for 2 years. All we need to do is take some risk to achieve certain things in life
That's true.  I guess that's why I'm trying to write.  I'm not saying I would quit my day job, but it could start a second career for me.  Do you ever read comics?
One of the horses just got loose and we can't find him!
Yeah I love Comics. This keeps my sad day an interesting one. Whenever I am sad I start reading a comic book
I hear ya!  They always pick me up too.  I know at my age I should be reading novels but part of what draws me to comics are the graphics.  Any chance you draw?  That's one thing I can't do!
I read a really good book last week. I wanted to know if you had read it.
Sure, you know how much I love reading. What was the name of the book?
The book is called Children of the Corn. As a farmer the title really stood out to me, but it's actually a really scary book.
Yes, it is a scary book. I have read it and, actually, enjoyed it. Not sure I would have read it though if I was a farmer like you. Haha. How is the farm these days?
Glad you enjoyed the book. The farm is doing well, thanks for asking. I have been selling some of my produce at the local farmers' market. Sales are better than I expected.
That is great! I would love to visit the farmers market but I only eat Kosher foods. Maybe we can meet up one day and you can show me how the tractor works. I have a movie coming up and the actor whose stunt double I am will be playing a farmer.
Showing you the tractor would be fun, especially with this new movie. I'd like to hear more about it, how is your work as a stunt double going lately?
It is good. Quite a bit tiring at time. I really enjoy what I do even though I am not typically an active person. I try to get in the groove by listening to music but haven't found the right type yet. Any suggestions?
On no, what are you going to do? Are they tagged so that you know they are your animals?
That's a tough one. Since I mostly listen to classical music, I don't get into a lot of upbeat or popular music. When I do yoga I listen to Chopan or Mozart. It really gets my blood pumping. Yoga is good cardio. Maybe try that?
I definitely try that. I hear classical can be really motivating if you pick the right artist. My mom was a single parent and used to play mozart on long car rides to pass the time. How is your sister doing?.
Guess you have your next song picked out then. My sister isn't doing well. She is in the hospital from a bad car wreck.
I am so sorry to hear that. I hope she will be ok. I am sure the people at your church will pray for her. I am here if you need anything from me..
My fiance and I have been spending the last few days doing a lot of wedding planning.
How's the planning going, any hitches?
Everything is going well so far. We are going to invite some family members from out of state. This is a difficult part. My grant parents may not be able to fly because of their health problems
Oh no thats so sad, it would be nice to livestream it then perhaps they could still be a part of it.
Yeah I guess livestream of the wedding may be an option. I would very much like to see their smile when we recite our vows though
I'm sure it would be a memorable moment for them, i still remember seeing my siblings get married.
Yes they are tagged thankfully! We already sent a notice to an organization that helps finding lost domestic animals, and we are waiting for some updates. It makes me really anxious, I think I need to listen to some relaxing music. Do you have any recommendations?
Oh cool. How are your siblings doing? Do they also live in North Carolina?
Yes, some do, but some live all the way over in California, don't get to see them that much.
Wow California and North Carolina. You guys live on the opposite sides of the US. I can see Thanksgiving trip can be a hassle for you guys?
Yeah, we take turns hosting them so that's a bit better, kinda look at it as a trip to california is part of the holiday vacation
Nice. I am currently in the army so I don't get to travel a lot. I have a cousin living in California. He loves it there!
Yeah, my siblings say the same thing, so where are you stationed right now?
You know what. You should bring your kids over so that they get together and have fun while we do some recording at the studio.
That would be fun. Should I bring my guitar?
Yes, you should! Will you bring your dog too? My home has been quiet since my divorce.
Probably not, he an old dog and just likes to chill out at home mostly. How are the kids coping with the divorce?
That's good. I really hope you find them. In terms of music I like to listed to chilled out Ibiza classics but to some people that isn't relaxing LOL. Classical music can be relaxing also. If in doubt ask Alexa to play a relaxing playlist and someone will probably have done the hard work for you.
The kid seems to like the mom more. How is your marriage doing?
Often they like their mom more to begin with, they'll come round. My marriage is good.  It's just trying to find stuff to talk about apart from the kids that's a struggle.
Kids keep me busy. How old are your kids now?
They are 3, 5 and 6. So I am really busy. What about yours?
Mine is 8.Do your kids go to the same school too?
Yes, once the youngest starts they will.
How have you been doing with your animal rescue?
It's going smoothly. I get many calls from the locals regarding rescue missions and I volunteer for it when I get the chance. Otherwise, I;ll be pre-occupied with my work. How's your photography going?
The photography is going well. Have a few weddings lined up.
Oh really> That's good to hear. Any new projects that you are working upon currently?
Oh no! That must be so scary. Can you switch departments?
Thank you! I hope so too. By the way, I would like to start running every morning. Do you have any advice on that? Should I bring water, do I have to eat before or after...?
Trying to paint a photo of my apartment building. I'm trying to launch a new born photography package too.
Oh wow. You have a very interesting life indeed.
What do you do in the shipyard?
I load up the crates to the trucks. That may sound easy but it is quite a bit difficult as I have to be precise before loading up those big crates as a single miscalculation can put lives of people over here working in jeopardy.
That does sound tricky. Do you use a crane or a forked-lift?
A crane. That too a big one.
Sounds, hard work. Do you hang out with anyone from work?
Yes. There are many coworkers who go for a drink after our shift ends. Me included.
How has the job search been going? Are you still thinking of working as a park ranger? How are your daughter's musical pursuits going?
Not as well I'd hope. Having an MD gets you far in the medical world but isn't worth much when applying for park ranger jobs. My daughter is having more luck than I and may be playing a public concert soon.
Yeah sure. Take water definitely. Eat before but not too much. You just need energy for the run so a banana, fruit or a small bowl of cereal perhaps.
Have you thought about doing a crash course in veterinary medicine? Is that something they look for in a Park Ranger?
I imagine they need to know a little but vets have to go school almost as long as doctors. I was hoping that'd just be something they taught on the job.
That is such a shame. What type of music does your daughter play?
She can actually play a multitude of genres and instruments. She started off playing orchestral stuff but seems to moving on to something more contemporary for the mean time.
That's amazing. She must practice a lot. What are your plans for the weekend?
She puts her heart and soul into her music. I don't have much plans for the weekend besides maybe studying and job searching. What about yourself?
Just working this weekend. And watching net-flicks.
Anything interesting that you're watching.
Line of duty it's a BBC Police Drama.
I haven't heard of it but I usually like police and crime dramas. Is it based on anything real or is it entirely fictional?
Thanks! I've always wanted to start running. How did you get into running yourself btw?
Are you going to watch the NASCAR race tomorrow?
Yes I actually won tickets to go watch it in person! Super excited for it. Are you going to watch it?
No, but i would love to.
Lol it'll be good! Speaking of sports, have you been watching your children play soccer a lot?
Yes they love playing it. Does your children play any games?
I don't have children, but my dog Barnaby does love to swim and run along the beach and is very entertaining to watch! Lol does that count?
hey you are funny! Do you like to eat?
Haha why thank you! I love to eat. My favourite food is sushi, what about you?
My favorite food is Italian. Do you like to watch movies?
Yum nothing like a good fettuccini Alfredo! I watch a lot of movies, my favourite is called "The Notebook". I like sad, romantic movies. What about you?
I started walking and realised that just wasn't really getting me fit. I decided to start with small distances and went from there. Some people find it easier than others.
I like action and romantic movies. These movies will made my day good
Movies are a good way to pass time!
How have you been feeling with your pregnancy? When are you planning on going on maternity leave from the bank?
I've been doing okay, thanks for asking. Pretty tired but that's to be expected I suppose. I'm planning on staying full-time at work until I'm 7 months.
You must be really dedicated. I can barely stand my job as is, I couldn't imagine doing it while carrying another person around and potentially being sick often.
The maternity benefits are pretty rubbish so that's why I'm hoping to stay on as long as possible. I'm hoping the sickness will get better soon.
That's a shame to hear but that's pretty common from what I understand. Least since this is your second pregnancy you'll know what to expect and can hopefully handle things better.
Yeah, it just sucks with how backwards the US is in regards to maternity leave and things. What is it like in the Netherlands/.
We're a bit more progressive on issues like maternity and paid leave in general, but that doesn't mean we don't have our own problems. Still I like living here and couldn't imagine living anywhere else.
I would love to move abroad but I think at this point it will definitely just stay a dream :(
I am actually really excited for it. I am definitely going to start with small distances in my neighborhood. Hopefully, I will get into it
I imagine it's hard to save funds when you have a kid and two more on the way. Do you think you'll ever switch careers to maybe something more lucrative ... or maybe decide you want to spend more time with your kids?
Hopefully. I think I am going to try and set up a business from home once the twins are here. Working for myself would give more flexibility
Working from home sounds like fun. You'll get to see your family more and even set your own hours. I imagine it requires a good deal of self discipline, but I'm sure you have that in spades.
Yes, I just really need to think of a good idea and then go with it. Fingers crossed as it would make my life so much easier.
I'm looking forward to the NASCAR race this weekend.
Sounds exciting! How did you get your job?
I've always been interested in building things since I was young so I wanted to pursue what I like. Yours sounds more exciting! Its something to be proud of. How long have you been doing it?
I was excited when I first got it 5 years ago, but its been tough to like it ever since I started. Do you eat anything other than enchiladas?
I want to watch your performances if thats ok! And you can also watch NASCAR with me! My favorite is enchiladas, I love mexican food! What do you often eat when working?
That sounds amazing, I never watched NASCAR. I love Mexican food as well, but eating that while working would be a bad idea! I make sure to a lot of protein when working and avoid oily foods, chicken and rice, with a side of stir fry is my go to.
You will get into it in no time. Get a tracker or take your phone so that you can chart your progress. It can get quite addictive. :-)
I might take that into consideration as well, since working for construction is very tiring as well. Eating good sounds like a good idea. So when is your next circus performance?
I am off from work for the next three days but I have a big performance coming up this Friday. My girlfriend usually comes on Fridays but is busy with a big meeting, would you maybe like to come?
Yes, thank you for the invite! If its ok with you I would like to bring my girlfriend as well, I'm sure both of them would get along since she's also studying finance.
This morning at the animal shelter I saw the cutest puppy.
Oh I love puppy. What was its breed?
It was a mix, but I could tell it had some husky in it. I used to have a husky when I was growing up.
Oh that's great. By the way do you know my husband he also used to work in the military?
I'm not sure, what part of the military was he involved in?
He is an marine and He loved to serve for the nation
Oh, I was in the Air Force so I doubt we knew one another!
Are there any helpful apps for running?
I have a garden in my house and do you have any tips for gardening?
I've had trouble with deer and squirrels, but I've learned that putting hot pepper flakes around the garden is a good natural way to repel them.
Good it might be helpful to me. Thank you for your response. Do you need any tips regarding flowers?
If you know of anything that's not common knowledge in the gardening community, I'd love to learn a few tricks!
Here's the fact that all flowers are colorful because it needs to attract bees and insect for its reproduction
I have great news! I had a huge online sale of my cosmetics last night!
That's amazing, wish I could say the same things about my job! What kinds of things do you like to shop for?
Mostly clothes and makeup. I love trying out new eyeshadows especially to see how different colors look, and what blends the best. Have you bought anything fun recently?
That's nice. I recently bought a second car, a sports car! I trying to prepare for the single life. Are you single?
Ooh nice! Is it more fun to drive? And yup, I'm trying to make it on my own for a bit, it's nice being independent.
Yeah sure. Strava is a good one. There are loads though
It totally is, I don't know why I haven't bought it sooner. That's good to hear, I have a hard time remembering the times I was single after 20 years of marriage.
That makes sense. How are you doing with the divorce? Are you going to be moving?
I'm doing alright, thanks for asking. At first it was hard but I'm getting there. And yes, I will be moving, a fresh new start is much needed.
That makes sense. Are you staying in the same city? Have you started looking at houses?
I finished repairing the flooring in my study last night. I'll have my own study area again, away from the family bustle.
Wow, good for you. I bet that was a lot of hard work. What is your next house project?
I think I'm going to switch most of the carpets to being wood floors. I like the look better.
That is a great upgrade too. Makes your home more valuable. I went out with some friends last night to an 80s themed party.
That sounds like fun! What is your favorite 80s movie?
Ooh, I liked a lot of 80s movies. Off the top of my head I would say Top Gun for action.
Have you gotten your cell phone fixed?
I like Back to the Future! It's my favorite.
Oh, that is a good one too. I also love Batman!
I could never get into superhero movies. So many remakes are hard to keep track of.
That is very true. I can understand that. How's your family?
They're doing great! My anniversary is coming up so I'm trying to think of something special to do.
Oh, nice! What number anniversary is it?
How are piano lessons going?
They are going okay, a lot of progress is being made. How is your studying?
Great to hear it. It takes special people to teach. My studies are going well. Can't wait to be finished though.
Ah thanks. That is good to hear, I imagine studying is pretty tough so good on you for sticking with it. How much longer do you have?
I have not had a chance yet.  I'm still trying to figure out who has the best deals for prices.  I can't believe how expensive it is to fix one!  It's so hard to spare the money when you have so many other expenses, ya know?
One more year then the decision of what to do career-wise. Do you think you would ever go back to school?
I don't think so, but I may change my mind in the future. Do you have a company you think you would like to work for?
Not really, not yet. My family wants me to help with the practice but I'm not sure I want to do that.
I see. How long have your family had the dental practice?
Oh about 15 years now. It is pretty well established. My sister works there as well which makes my parents happy.
Nice. Do they live far away from you?
No, not at all. We live about 15 minutes apart. The practice is about 25 minutes from my home.
It must be convenient that way. Do you guys spend a lot of recreational time together?
I went to another AA meeting an hour ago.
How did it go? I'm sure they're proud of you for your recovery.
At this point it's not possible without getting an even greater reduction in pay. I'm still toying with the idea of returning to school.
That's frustrating. They make them so hard to fix without taking it right to the original company who basically will charge you the price of a new phone. What broke about it again?
Thank you and it went very well. They encouraged me to take up basketball in my free time.
Oh, did you used to play as a kid? I did for a few years in elementary school.
I did in elementary school and high school, then kind of fell out of it. Things kind of got worse in my life when I stopped playing.
I can imagine how nice it is to be part of a team and feel close to a whole group of people. That support will probably be good for you! Have you found a team to join?
Not yet, but a few of my friends play in a recreational league. Have you ever done something like that?
Not in my adult life. Honestly, I kind of miss the structured organizations like that. I used to be involved in so many activities until I graduated, and then it seemed to just all stop.
That's unfortunate. However, it's never too late to get back involved. Things like this help keep my mind in a good place.
That's a great perspective to take. I think I too often think of making new friends as a young person's thing, when that's not actually the case at all! I'd love to meet new people.
Yes, I have the exact same problem but I think meeting new people will definitely help the both of us.
Not to mention get to invite more people to my dinner parties! I remember growing up my parents always held big gatherings on the farm. I miss it.
The screen.  One of my grandkids was watching youtube videos and dropped it and the screen just shattered.  I bet you're smart enough to not let your kids use your phone!  ha!
Did you practice the piano any today?
Every day! I'm trying right now to learn Für Elise by Beethoven. I'm sure you've heard about it
Oh yes, that is a nice one to learn and to practice with. How often do you practice the piano?
Piano literally every day M-F at least 1 hour and during the weekend at least 2. I really enjoy it. The goal is to learn and master at least one full song each week
That is an excellent goal. Do you prefer playing the piano or the violin?
I feel my fingers are too clumsy for the violin, but I love the sound of it. That means that violin is more of a challenge/hobby but the piano is really my thing. How good are you with the guitar?
That makes sense. I don't think I'm great with the guitar, but I really enjoy playing it. I try to practice about an hour a day as well. How long have you been playing the violin and the piano?
That's awesome, good for you! Great question, I believe the first time I started with giving a try to the violin was 4-5 years ago. The piano I've been playing it since I'm 8!
Oh wow, that's a long time! Would you recommend others pick up playing the piano or the violin as hobbies?
It all depends, right? There are so many hobbies one can be interested in. My advice is pick something that makes you happy rather than something someone else suggested. That way you're truly enjoying what you're doing and in the process learning something new
Hey, it happens. Lets just say they don't use it now, but I've had something pretty similar happen haha. I buy really cheap phones, and then I keep my last one around as backup incase I break one and need a quick replacement. I could send you my old one if you need something for a bit.
Yes, that is definitely good advice. I think that is the mindset to have when selecting hobbies. There is also value in asking others for their own experiences and viewpoints, so you are better informed.
Absolutely. My dad always says knowledge is power! There are some thing people do that one is even unaware of or that at least never sees or think of them as hobbies
I was watching hockey and my dog came and sat down next to me and started watching with me!
How cool! do you think collies are smarter than German shepherds?
okay. is this working?
how much of your own cooking do you do?
I do a lot of cooking - I have to being vegan you know. I do what I can but I am still learning. I'd like to get better you know - but my hummus is everything!
what are the ingredients in hummus?
I make a good one from chickpeas, garlic, tahini and olive oil - its simple but good.
is hummus a persian dish, or jewish?
That would be great!  I've learned my lesson!  Never again!  The grand kids can use their own devices that their parents buy them if they want to watch YouTube!  Although I think YouTube is terrible anyways!   When is your next Rolling Stones concert happening?
Its more Middle Eastern but there are varieties throughout the whole region
cool! which is your favorite caster at disney?
I like them all - so I guess they are all my favorites! Disney is a great place to vacation and hope to get back there soon.
do you have a season pass for the park?
Have you gotten a chance to do any climbing? Or have you worked on your Spanish at all?
Definitely, last month was my first time climbing Mt. Everest! What a thrill that was. In terms of the Spanish, I haven't gotten around to it yet.
I am ready to chat!
Are you all set to move in with your boyfriend? What are your thoughts and feelings on the move?
Wow Mt. Everest! That is such an accomplishment, congrats. If you can climb a mountain like that I'm sure you can learn Spanish if you set your mind to it.
Haha yeah, maybe. It's funny how that works. Everest felt like a breeze, whereas learning Spanish seems like the real mountain, to me anyway.
I know, there's so much crazy stuff out there. They don't have any shows around here until this winter. I'm looking at two events, either in October or December.
I love conversing in Spanish, let me know when you feel ready to hablar! Life has been so crazy for me I haven't finished packing for my move in yet! My boyfriend is so mad at me which has ruined the some of the fun. I still want to move in with him, I can't wait to live together 24/7. I know it will bring us closer.
One of these days, definitely in the near future I'll let you know. For now, me no hablas the Spanlais, haha. I'm sorry to hear that, but you're right about it ultimately bringing you closer. Relationships can be a challenge but you two will get through it, you always do.
I appreciate talking to you, it feels so good to vent about my relationship. We've been together for a little over a year now but it feels like a lifetime! I wish my boyfriend liked hiking I wish I could go on adventures more often. Mountains are beautiful places to have photography shoots!
Hmm, well I have an idea - maybe we can all go hiking on one of the local trails? See how it goes; if he likes it maybe we can attempt one of the easier slopes later on in the future. But yeah definitely a very picturesque setting, you'll remember being at the summit of a mountain for a long time!
That sounds like a great idea! I heard the Red Rock Canyons in Colorado are very beautiful, it would be great to visit sometime. Red is one of my favorite colors.
Let's do that then! Let me know if your boyfriend is interested and we can go once you're more settled into the new living arrangement.
My daughter rode a mini horse at her riding lesson last week!
Oh wow! That's adorable! Which daughter, and what was the horse's name?
The older one and she rode the mini horse named Paul. I think she starts to like riding mini horses
So cute :) I like that name! I wish I had a horse, but they're pretty expensive. She must be very talented! Did you teach her how to ride?
Will it at least be indoors or is it still warm outdoors in the winter there?
Well no. She joined a group of girls and boys for a riding program. They meet once every week and I am sure they have a great time
Oh, cool! Yeah, maybe she'll go pro one day! Who knows? A girl from my school did that and she made a living off of it! Very fun stuff. I'd love to learn how to do tricks one day (Jumping over fences and such). Which breed of horse is your favorite?
I'd say Arabian. My horse is Arabian. She has beautiful silver hair and also she is pretty talented. I've had her for years you know!
Gorgeous! I love Arabian horses. Silver! How exotic! Sounds like something out of a video game or something, haha! What a beauty - Maybe you could send me a pic of her sometime. Now I want to save up for a horse of my own! You've inspired me!
Yeah who knows when my kids grow up they will ride my Laila. Yeah her name is Laila. But she will be old when my kids become old enough to ride her.
Awh, well, that would be nice! Hopefully she still has enough strength in her by then. That's a nice name. Have you ridden horses in your family for generations, or did you start the tradition yourself?
I wouldn't call it a tradition. I don't ride horses any more. My wife doesn't ride horses so it's just our kids that are interested in horse back riding
Oh, I see, well it's a fun hobby either way. I do it out of tradition. My father is a farmer - His name is Jack. It's great exercise, I'll tell you that much, haha! Great way to bond too!
Do you have your eye on any cool cars?
Yes. I fancy a Mustang
Yeah thankfully. There is a big stadium they can close the roof on. Nice to be able to sit down for it unlike some shows where you're just standing around a field.
Is there a particular color you want? I know you have an orange car already, which is my favorite color, so would you be looking for something similar?
I would go for red this time. It gives it a classic look. What plans do you have this weekend?
That sounds cool. I would probably go for a hike. There is something so freeing about just being out in the open on a trail. What about you?
I really don't have any big plans?  Maybe you should come to the gym with me before or after your hike
I could do that. I am not working right now so I have lots of free time. what type of workouts do you do.
I like to do cardio and weights. I am sure you're fit as a result of your frequent hikes
I consider myself pretty fit comsidering my age. I look forward to trying some new workouts with you
That' s great. We can get some fish food while we are out. i have run out
That sounds great. My sister and I are running low as well. What is your fishes name?
Great. My fish is called Bubbles. He's a gold fish
I've seen those stadiums!  They're pretty cool!  Much nicer than the shows in the fields!  How's your step mom doing?
How is your Yorkie adjusting?
It is good. How long do you repair cars
I have been repairing cars for 10 years now. How do you like your BMW?
I like My BMW a lot. Because It was my first ever car
Oh that's so cool. I think BMWs are great starter cars because they are so smooth to drive. Do you take road trips?
Yeah I will take road trip once every weekend with my friends. If you don't mind you can join if you like it
Oh that would be awesome, thank you. Where do you usually like to travel to on your road trips?
I like drive to the countryside and enjoy sometime with friends
That is great. Do you plan on taking the dog along with you on the road trips?
It might be god idea. I love dogs and they are very friendly
Ups and downs. She is pretty tired some days. She has a great spirit about it though, so that's pretty admirable
Are there any places you haven't been on road trips that you would like to go to?
I wanted a trip to Miami and enjoy the beach
How long will it be before your due date?
We have got 4 months left. I am getting really excited but it is hard with a new baby and starting a new job. Would you like a family one day?
I think that children are such a blessing. How are you feeling?
Me too. We feel blessed that we are having this little one. Not sure whether it is a boy or girl, we said we will find out at the birth but feeling anxious as I am finding it difficult to shop.
You can always shop for items in colors like yellow or green, which are gender neutral. There are also decorations like animals that work for both.
Yes I think that is probably best. My husbands want to buy the baby it's first mini skateboard because he loves it so much!
Awww, I am sure that will be very cute. Maybe you can hang the skateboard as a decoration until he/she is ready to use it!
Yes that is what he wants to do. He wants to put it up on the wall. Not sure what style though? What do you think we should go for?
That's great that she's staying positive.  That mindset always helped me get through the hard times!  Sometimes positive thinking helps more than you'd think!
If you are not sure if it is a boy or a girl then I would say go for something gender neutral. Like you can just get something in bright colors or a pattern.
Ok sounds good. I was thinking like a checkboard pattern. Simple but easy to decorate around too. Have you skateboarded since your accident?
I am still taking it easy. I think it is important to recover totally before you try again.
Yes recovery is important. Are you seeing a physio yet to get back movement in your arm?
So tell me more about Spook; what kind of cat is he?
He's a lovely persian black cat with most beautiful orange eyes... is the love of my life I've had him for almost 14 years now
He sounds like a wonderful cat. Does he like to nap?
Yea given his age I'd say he spends over 16 hours sleeping these days. But he still plays, runs and will spook you every time. He makes me happy and also likes to eat pizza with me LOL
That is awesome. I never knew cats could eat pizza! Do you ever take him with you when you go to the beach?
I give him the crust and some beef toppings only haha. We tried once but he didn't like to walk on the sand. Otherwise he does like to go on walks with me
Oh yeah. I read this one book called The Butterfly Garden by Dot Huchinson. It was very dark and disturbing, but it was true crime/fiction. And it is still haunting me. It is a book in her collectors series. I have not yet been able to get myself to read the others in that series because it hit me pretty hard.
That's not a bad idea, maybe go back to school and find your passion. Maybe you could even hit Disney before school started.
So which country did you come from again?
I came from Australia, I miss it sometimes!
No way that's great. Where about a in Australia? I've heard it's a beautiful country.
I grew up in Sydney, it is so beautiful! I'd love to go back and visit.
That's amazing. I have always wanted to go but the flights are so expensive. When were you last there?
It's been years! I still talk to friends and family that I have from there. I've been looking into going back to visit for about a month.
That is so cool. What made you leave?
My family moved here when I was 15. I just ended up staying here because I made friends here and then ended up landing a nice job! It would be nice to move back if I didn't have a great job.
I think a lot of people move these days for work and end up away from their home country. As long as you are happy where you are that is all that matters.
That is true! Hows your dog doing/
Haha maybe I should go to school in Orlando. Speaking of school, how is your degree coming along?
He's Ok thanks. Walking him is a chore bit at least it keeps me fit LOL.
That' nice! What kind of breed is he?
What kind of adventures do you get up to at the orphanage?
I have a few friends that have secret powers too. They can do different things like go invisible and stretch really far. We like to hang out and make sure the orphanage is protected.
That is the most bizarre thing I have ever heard. How did you get these powers and can adults see them or are they just for you and your friends?
We are the only people we know of that can see them or use them. It would be cool if I could find a family to live with that had them too!
Well I think you should first agree what you will do with them. Will you use them to help people, or further your evil agends?
I want to catch bad guys and protect the weak.
Well that's a relief. I thought I may be speaking to a supervillain.
I'm a little afraid of supervillains although I haven't met one yet.
Good, I was finally able to find a job that valued it. Who knew economics wouldn't be easily employable. What would you go back to school for?
Well you will in time as I'm sure you will need to fight them to keep people safe.
Maybe when I'm older and stronger. I'm still in training. I need a good side kick. Like a dog or something.
I think a dog is a great idea. You can train them to fight by your side.
Like a police dog! They are very scary looking. Plus they wear bullet proof vests!
How many cats do you have?
I have six cats. Some would say that is too many cats to have but I really value all of them and enjoy having all of them around at all times.
Wow! Did you get all of them at once?
Only two of them were acquired at the same time. They are brother and sister and I got them both from a breeder. The others are all rescues. I find it enjoyable to know that I helped out a helpless animal. In fact, I'm always open to rescuing more so I could imagine having up to nine or ten cats.
That is interesting. Do you have kids?
No but I do consider my cats to be like my kids. Maybe that is why I have such an affinity for having so many cats. What about yourself? Do you have kids?
Given your experience, possibly economics! Definitely something that doesn't involve hospitals.
No, I don't have kids. I want kids soon though.
Well, until then, you at least have your cat to fill that void! Maybe you should get more cats like me in the meantime. I know some cats aren't fond of other cats coming in to a home. Do you think your cat would be ok with more cats?
Not at all! My cat cannot stand other cats. How is it working on roofs in the summer?
I don't mind it but I know its not for everyone. It certainly gets warm up there but a solid layer of sunscreen and plenty of fluids ensure that I have the endurance to do the work. Plus, since I do work on houses in general, I'm able to schedule the roof on cloudy days.
Okay. Do you own the business or are you a contractor?
I actually work for with my dad. It's a family business. I suppose I'm lucky because my dad has been a great teacher for the industry. I suspect that when he retires he will pass the business down to me if I'm still interested in working in the industry. What kind of work do you do and is it the reason you are living in Beijing?
Is there anything you do like about school?
Well, I do like art class. I would like to go into art or design when I'm older.
That's good. What type of art do you like to do?
I like all types but my favorite are sculpture and pottery.
Haha I can only imagine how bad you need a break from hospitals. If you'd like I can show you how to coupon to help save money when you go back in school
I always wanted to try pottery, is it easy?
It is difficult at first to get the clay to conform to the shape you want. But it gets easier with practice. I'm sure you can find some instructional books on pottery at your bookstore.
I might just go have a look and see, I believe we do have books on pottery.
So what kind of dog do you train?
I train German Shepherds and Poodles.
I've been begging my parents to get me a dog, but they want to wait until I am older.
Probably try and do things around the house that can convince them that you're responsible enough to have a dog.
Yeah, I am trying to be more responsible when it comes to completing my chores on time as well as keeping my grades up.
Have you talked to your family recently?
Not lately, I have been really busy with school. We do text at least once a day just to check in. Have you picked a big city you want to move yet?
I'd really appreciate that! Hopefully I'll qualify for some scholarships, but I'll need to save every dollar I can.
I feel that, it's hard to balance school and family. And yes, I'm considering San Francisco. Have you ever been?
That sounds like a fun place to be! I have not been there myself but hope I get to visit some day. Have you ever been there?
I haven't, but it seems cool. I'm also considering Austin, which feels very multi-cultural. I think I would have to learn Spanish. Do you know any other languages?
My English is not so good. I speak Hmong. I use the computer to translate. I also use my phone.
Oh cool! Do you have any friends that also speak Hmong?
My friend Noah does but he mostly speaks English. His Hmong isn't that great but we understand each other most of the time.
Nice--I'd love to meet more bilingual people. Where I live is pretty small and not very diverse.
New York City is a melting pot. I visited there and loved it! Did the whole tourist thing while I was there.
I'm so jealous! Maybe I should just move to NYC lol
Yes! That would be so cool! So many things to do and so many people from everywhere!
You have inspired me I signed up with a local soup kitchen to help during the holidays, maybe it will help with my seasonal depression.
What is it like working at a shelter?
Sometimes hard, the stories you hear are pretty sad. But it's always uplifting. Everyone is always pretty thankful for the help.
That's good, yeah I imagine some of the things you would hear are upsetting. It's very good that you help people. How did you get into that line of work?
I just started volunteering one day in highschool to get some hours for graduation. I didn't expect to do it long but I felt so needed there and the work seemed so important to me.
Awesome. I'm not sure what I want to do as a career at all.  Maybe volunteering will help me decide.
You're young, don't worry too much. But yes, any sort of volunteering would be some great life experience, even if you go to a local library and help them put books back or something. Anything will broaden your horizons a bit.
That's an idea. It will probably help with my college applications as well!
For sure, it always looks great. What are your hobbies right now? Maybe you could find something that intersects.
At the moment I am playing in my school band and have just taken up running. I'm training at the moment and hoping to run a K next week. I'm so unfit but!
Wow, that's more than I've ever run. I just can't push myself like that.
I think that this will actually be great for you! How do you feel now?
I didn't think I would like running but I actually do. Have you found any new parts of the city?
I found a small street in China town I didn't know about before. They have a little market some days with some really interesting food. Always a nice treat.
I had a dance practice today. I was so tired after practice.
What kind of dancing do you do?
I love ballet dancing. Have you ever tried ballet?
No, I'm too young for that, although one of my dolls, Katie, is a ballet dancer.
How many dolls do you have? I enjoyed playing with my dolls when I was growing up.
Three!  Katie, Sally and Ken, they keep me company when my Mom is at work. She works late at night and brings home bags of dollar bills!
If there's one thing I love more than ballet it's bags of dollar bills! Does your turtle have a name?
Yes Milely!  She listens to me tell stories about stuff when I'm waiting for Mom to come home.  With Miley, I'm never alone!
I am feeling hopeful. Since I grew up poor, I know how it feels to be helped when you need it and I'm happy to do that for someone else.
In the alleys, are there any foodstuffs that you're likely to pick up? Leftovers?
Stores just throw out perfectly good stuff all the time!  We save money so Mom can buy her "Stuff" and then we go home and she sleeps all day until it gets dark again.
Ah, that makes sense. Sounds pretty tough. Actually reminds me of when I was growing up in Somalia. I'd have killed for some fast food back then.
Somalia?  Was there shooting every night like it is here?
So why do you have to move?
I burnt too many bridges here and I want to start fresh in a place no one knows me. Small towns are nice to visit but not for long term.
Yeah I get you. I hope you find a good small town, Which ones are you considering?
Oh no. I'm coming from a small town. I want to go bigger. I'm tired of small towns. Everyone gossips.
That makes a lot more sense. haha! Big cities are the same if not worse, depending on what crowd you are in. If you are in the world where networking is your life, then they gossip too.
That is so true! Where do you think you might move to? East coast or West coast or somewhere in-between
Yes, that is why the soup kitchen idea is such a joy!
I feel like moving to Santa Barbara. It is a good size city, but also low key. Have you been there? Is it on the west coast.
No but it sounds nice. I will google it. Maybe it's right for me.
It could be. What towns are you looking into? Have you seen some places yet?
I want to find an area with great city night life and parks to visit during the day. Do think Santa Barbara is like that? I don't want to drive too much either.
Maybe Sacramento up north or San Diego down south. I feel like those may be your best bet. I like both of those cities.
That sounds great. Maybe we could get together when we move! Go out for a night on the town!
Do you think to buy a dog
I have been watching the shelters around me. I'm thinking I may go get one this weekend!
Awesome! Any idea what size or breed you would like or are you not bothered?
I like the idea of a bigger dog. They're just so big and friendly. There's a nice lab I visited. He's still on hold and getting some shots, but I haven't stopped thinking about him.
Wow. That sounds like something I would really love. I just finished a book myself this morning about a serial killer. Do you read your books through Kindle? Or check them out from the library?
What inspired you to dye your hair purple?
Hopefully you will be able to get him. Labs are great dogs although they do need alot of exercise. Do you think you will need a dog walker or will you be able to do that yourself?
We have a pretty decent sized yard, and a nice dog park in our neighborhood. But, if I do need a walker, I know who to call!
Haha, good to know! There is a lot more competition now, loads of people have started up dog walking business' near me.
I imagine it's an easy business to start, but hard to keep with it. How long have you been doing it?
I started it in college. It took alot of effort to build up my business' but now mostly it is repeat customers as they trust me with their pets. I do enjoy it , nearly all of the dogs are well behaved.
That is nice, you have long term customers at least. How do you think your PHD studies will work in with your business?
It should be fine. It is pretty flexible and most people understand. What about your work?
I guess it could be a nice break from studying sometimes too, getting outside and walking around. It's been fine. Work is work, ups and downs. I can't complain though. Pays the bills.
What was the most beautiful country you have visited? Or at least give me your top 5, I would like to hear it.
My favorite region is the Caribbean so I would say top five are Jamaica, St. Lucia, Aruba, The Dominican Republic, and Barbados.
I just wanted something different at the moment! Would you ever consider dying your hair?
Wow, you've really seen a lot of the area! I've been to the Dominican Republic, but haven't been to any of the others yet. But now that I'm retired, I'm hoping to take more vacations - especially cruises!
Yeah, cruises are the best. It's like two vacations in one. The trip there is a vacation and then when you dock, you have another vacation exploring the country.
True. Not to mention all the food you can eat! And an on board gym to balance it out...haha. I've got to stay in shape because sometimes I still substitute teach if they need someone for the gym classes.
Yeah, lol. There is nothing worse than a gym teacher that is out of shape. I'm thinking about teaching economics online so I can still travel the world.
That's a great idea. Would you be able to teach from your yacht? I'm sure the students would love to see that!
Yes, I can teach from my yacht because I have a satellite internet system installed. As long as the weather is great I can get online and my yacht would serve as motivation for them to manage their money well too.
That's so true! I'm sure you'll be a great economics teacher because you've lived it, and have so much real life experience to share. And telling about all the places you've gotten to visit will be motivating as well!
So, have you seen any good documentaries lately? I have a Netflix subscription that I watch sometimes in the middle of a trip.
Have you seen Dawn Wall? That one was amazing. It made me want to go to Yosemite! You'd have to find another mode of transport besides yacht though...
No I haven't seen that one yet, but I've seen Free Solo, which is about a similar subject so I think I'll like it.
I don't think so, I'm way too old for that. I don't have much hair anymore!
I am very exhausted from redecorating my new house. Also, job has been rough lately
how many more rooms have you got to decorate at your new place?
just my son's room and the twin's future room. Only so much i can do in a day, but i can only imagine what you can accomplish with your powers in a day.
well exactly I can do things in a fraction of the time these days, I was going to offer my assistance! When are the twins due?
3 months from now. I have my own stool at the bank for me to sit on to rest my feet. I can only imagine how much free time you have.
really getting there! Glad to hear the bank are helping you out, I was worried the stress of your work might not be doing the twins any good
The stress is being kept at bay. You want to talk about stress though, the stress i would be under if i was like you with my heart outside my body. What do you do to protect it?
yes I do have to be very careful! Avoiding crowds is one of the keys to success I'd say. Although it is covered by a lightweight metal frame, so that takes most of the little knocks without any worries
That's good to know. You also have your telepathy if you see anything harmful coming. Be able to stop it that way. Have you used your powers to help anyone?
unfortunately it's not easy to use my powers to protect myself, the heart being on the outside is my kryptonite if you will!  I have been trying to use my powers to help people, but it often freaks them out a little. I did manage to stop a car before it hit a pedestrian though
Well, I think you could still do something cool perhaps! Any ideas?
HAve to do what you can do. Glad you can help someone in need. Made try a way to make your appearance more inviting. Kind of how i'm trying to make my new home.
yes that's a good idea. maybe if I help you out with the rest of your decorating you could help me out with my appearance?
I finally managed to order organic food off the internet, but will definitely visit your store soon
That's nice. Do you have a favorite Country Music artist?
Of course, I really like Maggie Sajak. I only listen to female artists, and I find her music very unique and interesting.
I have only listened to her popular songs. I have not listened to much of her catalogue. How good is she?
She very good and talented. I wish she would release another song, or even an album. Its been a while since her last release.
Hmmm. I will definitely check her out. I love country but I have been listening to some Reggae lately.
Reggae is interesting to listen to as well, have you found a favorite artist for that genre yet?
Yes, I like Protoje. He is very very good.
I would like to change my wardrobe. I haven't bought new clothes in about 15 years.
I haven't had the chance to listen to him yet, what's your favorite song from him?
"Who Knows" featuring Chronixx. It's a really cool song.
I'll give it a listen to when I have the chance. Have you had any troubles recently with your work in the convenience store?
No, not at all. Everything has been smooth. How efficient are those solar panels?
How did the race go? Who was the winner?
The race is still going on, so I don't know the winner yet.
ah this must be a long one! Did you get any snacks to enjoy with the race?
Not yet, but I'm hoping to grab some tacos after the race is done. What kind of tacos do you like best?
good shout! I probably enjoy the classic chicken tacos the best, how about you? you seem to be quite the connoisseur
Thanks for the compliment!  I think my favorite are fish tacos, and I love to add pineapple salsa on top!
Wow, that would be so fun! Maybe you could try a store like Macy's!
wow that's very different! what inspired you to give that a try?
I brought pineapple salsa to a party with my coworkers once. They love to make tacos after work on Fridays. They were serving fish tacos and the pineapple salsa really went well with them!  Do you hang out with your coworkers after work?
well I'll have to give that a try some time.. I'll let you know how it goes! Yeah, I'm the same as you, we hangout most fridays, less exciting though, we just go to a bar usually
that still sounds fun, it's great to get to know people outside of work.  What kind of work do you do?
it does, I think it helps in work as well when you know people better. I work in the marketing department for an engineering firm. how about you?
I work in construction. I've been in that type of work since I was a teenager. I really like it but kind of wish I had gone into engineering. Do you like working in marketing?  That seems challenging to me!
My marathon training is going really well, yesterday I ran half marathon
That's fantastic. Did it feel amazing after everything you went through?
It did! It felt really good to be back to the level of fitness I was at before pretty much. I still have a bit to go but it gave me confidence.
So when is your full marathon?
I like Macy's. I used to shop there. Shopping is very hard for someone my age, though.
It is at the end of next month so I have about 5 weeks or so to prepare. I'm hoping to at least finish even if my time isn't great.
That's a great attitude. I really need to get my own fitness back up to what it was when I was a kid. What would you suggest?
I'd start with something easy, maybe just start going for long walks around your local park and you can build up from there.
That's a good idea. Small, simple steps seem to be better. What about nutrition? It's so hard when I'm traveling.
Yes it is very important you should try and follow some simple recipes to try and prepare your own food. Maybe start with a simple stirfy?
Is there a better way to learn than just looking up recipes? That always ends up in disaster for me. I just cannot seem to learn to cook.
Maybe you could see if there are any local cooking classes. Or failing that sign up for a meal subscription service - then you just need to reheat the meals.
That's a really good idea for when I'm home. It's hard when I'm sailing though. Maybe I can make some progress at home. What kind of salads do you usually do?
What type of photos do you learn to take in photography class?
We've learned a lot of different types actually! Most recently we've been working with candid photography
Right, I could just imagine. Perhaps hiring a shopper would be better then?
That sounds like fun!  I'm always amazed at picture people take!  Photographers are so talented!  All artists are!  I am awful at any kind of art!
You should try photography sometime! I promise it's nothing like painting.  Maybe we can go out to the city sometime and take some candid urban shots together?
That would be fun!  I always see cool murals on the sides of coffee shops and always think street art would be a cool thing to photograph!
Awesome! Are you free this weekend, or do you have to work? It's my husband's turn to deal with the kids on Saturday, so I'm free.
I'm free!  You'll have to pick me up in the mini-van though since I still haven't gotten a car!  How are your boys doing these days?
The boys have been a handful lately (as always), but on the whole I love them so much.  They've just got a lot of energy now that it's starting to get warmer outside.
At least they'll be able to get outside more!  Do all give of them play baseball?
The older ones do, and I think the youngest will start in a year of two when they're able.  It certainly makes things easier being able to take them all to the baseball diamond and just letting them play on their own.  Organizing their team practices on the other hand is a nightmare...
I can't even imagine trying to coach little ones!  How old are the ones you coach? I remember when mine were little and played sports!  The attention span was awful!  They'd be in the field picking flowers while a ball rolled past them!
I've coached ages ranging from 6 to 11.  There's definitely a lot of variability in terms of skill.  Some of them are really into it and very talented, others can struggle to pay attention.  It's always a crapshoot what the team is going to look like.
Since you've reached such an old age, do you have any advice for how to stay healthy and live long?
I recently went to a great cafe that just opened that features local bands.  It is nice to go there instead of a bar in the evenings.
Its good that we agree on the live music scene! I just wished the crowds didn't drink so much beer there!  What kind of music did they play?
Typical coffee-shop music, some acoustic stuff. It was pretty good. I always prefer live music. Yeah, it was nice to be at a cafe where it was mostly coffee and smoothies! How have your bagpipes held up? Have you still been playing those?
I hurt my lips on them last week so its been collecting dust for a few days. I plan on getting back soon though and play some new songs. Do you think the cafe would like my bagpipe playing?
Oh no, I hope you feel better soon! I think they would honestly. They're looking for local artists to build community and get their own name out there so you should definitely look into it! It's definitely unique. Do you write all the music you play yourself?
Thanks for the feedback! Its hard to find gigs that like Scottish metal played with a bagpipe. Sure, I write all of my own music. Have you ever heard of "Shake your Bum Bum"? That is one of mine.
It's definitely unique, but interesting enough to get people's attention. I haven't heard it, but I'll have to look it up! I'm always impressed by people who can write their own music. Hey, maybe the cafe will pay you enough so you can start saving up to move out! How is that process going?
Well, the folks have been getting a little tired of doing my laundry.  They said they love having me live in the basement but last week I cam home and the locks had been changed. I had to climb in through a window. Whats up with that?
Whaaat that's crazy! Have you asked them about it?
They said they didn't know anything about it. What is really strange is they still haven't given me a new key. Maybe I could crash on your couch?
I think it is luck I drink wine. I don't watch what I eat. I just try and enjoy life especially at my age.
Hm I don't think my parents would like that. Plus I wouldn't want to make you miss work. How is work going?
Yeah, I am really important at Burger King and you must have lots of home work. How is school going?
Are you in school or are you just studying on your own?
I am studying on my own from books and online courses. Once I have a solid foundation, I might consider formal education.
That's cool, do you have any idea what area of programming you might want to formally pursue?
I am concentrating on the Swift programming language because I am primarily interested in working with Apple products. What about you?
Nice, I've been focusing on Python.  I think I want to be a data scientist for a sports or entertainment company and I think it'd be a good entry language for that.
Oh okay. With your sports background, I think you'd be a shoo-in for a position in that field. I'm primarily looking to do freelance work because your skills are all that matter, not if you have a degree from a fancy university.
Yeah that makes sense, especially if your mom is going to make you stay in India.  Has her mind shifted on that at all?
No, she is very desperate that I stay in India because I'm her only son and she depends on me. Also, she is afraid I will face discrimination as a foreigner in America.
I have kindle unlimited and the libby app, but I believe that particular one was on Kindle Unlimited. It was about teenaged girls being kidnapped and locked in a giant jar and turned into butterflies permanently after the man and his son had their way with them. So I had to lay off her books for a bit. Oh! I also read Billy Straight. that was on libby from my library. It is AMAZING. and it is a true crime story! What was the book you read?
Haha well they say that wine keeps you young, so maybe there's something to it. Have you tried any great wines lately?
Dang, maybe you can get her to compromise and let you try living somewhere like Hawaii.  It's great here and not nearly as far from India as the mainland states.  Lot's of different demographics here too, I doubt you'd see any overt discrimination.
That's a good idea. The warm climate would be a plus as well. I experienced snow once on a trip and I wasn't a big fan of it.
Yeah the weather here is amazing, it's one of the best tings about Hawaii! Unless you decide to go way up near the top of the volcanos you'll never see snow either.
Yeah, and I imagine there would be lots of places to practice my swimming. I'm more used to pool swimming, but I would love to practice some open water swimming.
My band got a gig this weekend at the bar I work at.
That is awesome! Do you write your own music/lyrics?
We do about half the time, the rest of the time we do covers. Do you go to concerts very often?
Yes, I love going to concerts! I hope to go to some this summer. What type of music do you all play?
We do mostly metal music with some punk influences. My fourth graders get really confused when I try to explain it to them.
I bet, do you play the piano and sing for them during class?
I tried a Malbec just yesterday that was wonderful. I drank the whole bottle haha. what about you?
Yes I do, they really like it when I play the piano and sing in Spanish.
Neat, I bet they really enjoy that. Have you and your best friend moved into your new apartment?
We did, I'm trying to figure out which ones of my photographs to put up around the apartment. Do you display your photographs at your place?
Yes, I do--I have several photographs of some of our favorite places around our apartment.
That's awesome. Where was your favorite photo taken?
At a lake near our home. The photo was taken at sunset during golden hour, it is several years old and still my favorite.
I just found out I am going to Disney next week. I can't wait to get some candy.
That sounds exciting! What kind of candies do think you will get this time? Also, will you bring some back for me to try?
I like licorice and salt water taffy. Do you like those old fashioned candies ?
I enjoy almost any type of candy. So, are the licorice and salt water taffy the special candies that you get in Disney World? As long as its not chocolate, you should bring some back for me to try.
I tried a Rhone wine yesterday, and it was fire! I'm amazed you could finish an entire bottle!
Ok, do you want me to Bring you some Pluto themed toys ?
That would be awesome! I can pay you for them. I don't want it to be a burden on to you. Do you think you'll bring back some Mickey themed toys for yourself?
I think I have enough Mickey stuff, but I now that I will buy some more. I think I will have to give away some of my Mickey toys to make place.  Do you want some ?
If you are going to get rid of them, I would be happy to take them. I have a niece who would love them. I think she would be very happy to have a few new toys.
That would be my pleasure. I like to know that they will be still be appreciated. Do you keep all your Pluto toys ?
Of course! I have a bit of a Pluto shrine going between all the toys, shirts, and other general paraphernalia related to Pluto. I assume you do something similar for you Mickey gear?
There are some items that I keep, but I like to have a rotation. So I never need more space and I still have new stuff. Do you think you will need more space for your collection ?
If I keep accruing more Pluto related items, of course. I don't intend to get rid of any of my stuff related to Pluto. I do like the idea of decluttering my space by getting rid of some of my Pluto items but I just can't do it. I take pride in my collection.
What part of California to you plan to move to?
I found a job in San Francisco, so I plan to move there if I get this job! My daughter lives there as well.
Oh a bottle isn't that much. Remember I'm 100. I don't work. I have wine with my lunch and if it is a good bottle, that is my beverage for the day.
Sounds like a good city to be in if you can afford it. Are you planning on visiting your daughter often after your done moving in?
I'm hoping all goes well! Yes, I can't wait to visit a lot, we have lot's of plans for when I move..
Theres definitely lots to do in California as well. I would love to visit there at least once when I get the chance. Seems like an interesting place to have a vacation.
Oh yes, I'm very excited! Maybe you can plan a little trip when I move.
Not a bad idea, I'll see if I can get time off from my work as IT. Although I could even continue working a bit if I brough my laptop along.
That would be awesome! How is your job going by the way?
Its going well, I feel I am on top of things. I haven't really had any major setbacks or challenges in the past couple of weeks, its mostly been minor inconveniences, which is fine in IT.
That's good! Glad it's going well. Have you been keeping up with the Walking Dead?
I have, I just watched the latest episode yesterday. It was so good, I am really excited for season 11.
Yes, me too. It was so good, I don't know how long i'll be able to wait!
That's a good approach! Sounds like a great way to economize, too!
I started my job and I am loving it so far.
That's awesome! So you have clients already? How does it work exactly, do you meet with them in person once a week or so?
I don't have a bunch of clients yet as I only just started. But, I have a few and am starting to build up a portfolio of clients. Generally speaking, I keep in contact with them via E-mail or phone and do a weekly or bi-weekly meet up to make sure they are on the right track. If you want to try it out, I can get you scheduled with me or another agent for a free month trial.
Oh that would be awesome! I'd totally try it for a month. Not sure if it's for me but there's no harm in giving it a shot. Especially with the baby coming soon, I need to make sure my life's in order
I think it would be good for you! I'll speak with one of the other people who work here about setting up an appointment with them to get started. How soon until your next child is born? If its soon, I can try to schedule for your first appointment to be after that.
It's not due for another 4 months, so I'd be happy to get an appointment sooner! I have a kayaking trip I'm busy planning for right now, but maybe in 2 weeks if there's something available?
That sounds good. I'll look to see if anyone has availability to add a new client in two weeks.
Nice! What did you do before being a life coach? It seems like such a perfect fit for you
I was a part-time athletic trainer. I feel like my experience as an athletic trainer is what landed me this job. I know that the people interviewing me were impressed by my previous work history. I had done all kinds of different sports and general athletics related to it. Ironically enough, I actually have never been kayaking though!
