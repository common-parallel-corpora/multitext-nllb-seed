I've heard they're making a new Stephen King adaptation - I bet I end up going to see it!
Yeah, I am trying to get in on that one! I want to be in one of his movies because they are bomb!
You never know, with everything you have done in your past, I might read a book about YOU eventually! I can't even imagine what interesting stuff you'd be able to put in a book like that. My life is pretty monotonous so there wouldn't be much to put in a book about me.
I can do both, I start with sheet music most of the time and by the end of the song I am playing by ear. Do you have your yearly trip to Disney World planned yet?
WOW. That's incredible. Did you always want to do stunts?
Actually, it was in college. I realized it was my calling after a series of party mishaps.
Oh that's hilarious. Hope you didnt get too injured before you found your calling!
No injuries, just low grade property damage. You should definitely go to college, it was awesome.
Sounds like it's worth it just for the parties!]
Yeah, it was pretty good.
Any tips for getting into the habit of reading more?
I heard an old song from George Straight a bit ago and thought of you liking older music. Do you care for George Straight music from the 80s?
Not really. I'm not too into country music. I prefer stuff from artists like the Beatles and Billy Joel.
Now you're speaking my language, love the Beatles. What are some of your favorites by them?
Not yet.  I think we're going in the fall this year so it's not so hot.  I can't wait to go again.  Thunder Mountain is my favorite ride.  I think I'll try to ride it 20 times this year.
My all-time favourite Beatles song is "In My Life." My second-favourite is "Here Comes the Sun." What about you?
HELP! I need somebody, not just anybody! I sing this song so much its not even funny. HA. How's business going by the way?
Business is going well! We've been getting lots of customers recently. Despite its success, however, my family is still a bit disappointed with my career choice. How's the electrician business?
I hope they'll be able to support you better in the future. Business is slow but steady.
How's farm life treating you? I hear its a simple, peaceful existence. It sounds nice.
It's very quiet out here and I love it! I used to live in a busy city and you couldn't pay me to move back
I'd love to live in a tight-knit, quiet community. It sounds peaceful. But most of my friends and family live in the city, and I'd rather not leave them behind just yet.
I can understand that. We don't get many visitors but at least we have somewhere to travel when we want to see family
So what do you do for fun? Do you watch any TV shows or play any video games?
What is it like not being close to family? I do want to move to a big city but my family will not be close by anymore.
Wow, 20 times! You must really love that ride. Do you plan to visit all of the Disney parks?
It actually feels great! I know some families can be overwhelming but we are so happy to be able to see everyone whenever I want. Is there a big city close by? Maybe you don't have to move too far.
I guess I'm just anxious because it's not an easy decision to undo, you know? But if I want to be a lawyer I'll be so busy I don't have a bunch of spare time to see them anyway!
That's true! You have to think about your future.  How far are you going to be?
Not very far - a few hours - but I guess any distance at all seems like a big one to me!
Yeah, I can see that. But as long as you can still drive to see them, I think you will be fine. When are you starting school?
In September, if all goes to plan. But enough about me. How are the horses?
They are great! I love spending time in a barn. We recently purchased a new stalion. His name is Macho.
That's a great name for a horse! How many do you have altogether now?
Right now we have 3 horses and a donkey.  You would love them.  You need to visit sometimes.  Being around horses is so destressing.
I love donkeys! I do need to visit sometime, that's for sure.
Maybe one day, but we live closest to Disney World so that's the one we go to.  I also think it's better than Disney Land.  Where else are there Disney parks in the world?
We started farming bees too. That was my wife's idea.  I wasn't a fan at first but then it grew on me.
Do you want to go with me on our dancing class?
You know know how bad at dancing I am. I think it would be too embarrassing!
Yes, true haha. How about we hang out volunteering at the pet shelter? That could be fun
I think I would feel a lot more comfortable doing that! When you want to meet up to go there?
Not this weekend because I believe aunt is visiting. But I am available some other time
Just let me know! I want to make sure which ever one we visit has bunnies!
Haha of course, I know you love those bunnies. Have you thought about getting a pet?
I'd love to but I don't exactly want to be responsible for them every day.
I understand. I guess it's enough to be spending most days helping them a shelter, no?
In addition to California and Florida, there is Paris, Tokyo, Shanghai, and Hong Kong
Yes, I think doing it this way I feel more helpful. I wouldn't want to add more to my plate.
I completely get it. I'm sure you're already pretty stressed from the shipyard
Yeah, I am always soo tired when I get home. Do you have any interest in getting any?
Hi George, how are the bees?
They are good thanks making lots of honey at the moment for me.
Yeah that is great, maybe you can make a bit of money and help your wife out with the bills.
That would be great if I could she looks after me so well. How is your music coming along?
It's is going well just in the middle of writing a new song. Finding it hard still though to get the support of my parents.
Yeah thats a shame I'm sure they will give you some support eventually once they realise how good you are.
Yeah I really hope so it would be nice to have their approval.
Oh wow, that's a lot!  That really is a big goal to shoot for to go to them all.  Maybe I'll make a goal to visit all the parks with Thunder Mountain.
I would love to hear your song once you are finished writing it.
Yeah that would be great you could tell me what you think of it then.
I would love to I look forward to hearing it, I'm sure it is going to be good.
Thanks it's nice to have someone who is showing me some support its not easy writing music.
I bet it's not their must be so much competition out there these days people trying to make it big.
I signed up to play at the chess club. Would you like to join us as well?
Sure, I think that'd be fun. I'm no Bobby Fischer but generally I can hold my own haha
Oh, no problem. It's a pretty casual club so you'd fit right in. Have you traveled anywhere recently?
WEll, I was thinking about going to Florida for a week just to try and get some rest, but the hubby is sick so he nixed that. Have you traveled?
Not really. It's so expensive trying to find dog sitters around where I am! I would like to go somewhere with nice, warm, sandy beaches... any recommendations?
That is a great idea! Does your older sister like Thunder Mountain as much as you do?
Definitely Florida, then. Next time I go I think you'd get a kick out of it! I love sitting on the beach and reading
Me too! I also like to make beach bonfires. Is that allowed on beaches in Florida?
Some of them do, it shouldn't be a problem to find one that would let that happen. That'd be fun, roast some hot dogs or smores :)
Exactly! Staring into the fire, listening to the ocean, and talking with close friends. What more could you want?
A glass of wine? That would be a great topper to the whole proceedings!
Haha yes! Can't forget the wine! Boy do I love some wine in my bubble baths. It just makes everything better, doesn't it?
It's the perfect ending to a imperfect day, that's what my husband always says. But he's a construction worker, he has a lot of bad days
I started training for my next competition and my schedule is really busy these days.
Is a gold medal really gold? Like a solid gold coin? Or is it just gold plated?
Weirdly, they're mostly made with silver and then guilded. Though I don't really care what the actual material is worth, it's all about what it represents.
No, she's scared of roller coasters of any size!  She likes the teacups!  She has no problem with spinning around, just going up and down.
That's true. I was asking for my son, he's a bit on the curious side lol
Oh, is he interested in the Olympics?
Yes and no, he likes watching them but he's not really athletic. If it's money-related, he's very interested. He likes to wheel and deal
I see. I'm definitely making more for winning in terms of sponsorship deals than what the medal is worth, haha! I'm going to be in some ads soon.
Oh wow, that's awesome? Are you going to be on the Wheaties box?
Ha, no, but I do have an upcoming magazine spread with Nike!
I can't wait to see that! I love Nike, they are my favorite atheletic brand!
After this, they're definitely mine too! I'm really excited, it's a great oppertunity.
Well here is hoping that it nets you a sizable payday! :)
I saw a documentary on World War 2 and I am very sure you would like it. Have you seen it?
I had a thought, since you are out of work right now anyway why don't you give your dream job a shot?
Which documentary are you taking about? I have seen all kinds of them!
World War 2 in Colour. It is a Netflix documentary. It shows a lot of historic footage that's been restored in color and shown in high definition!
That sounds cool. I'll have to put it on the list. What have you been up to lately?
I've been hunting for some fitness clothing deals online. Since the weather is getting warmer, I thought I would stock up on some clothes so that I can be out and about but be comfortable!
I hear ya! I need to dig out some clothes. I stashed all the summer stuff away. Are you finding any good deals?
Yeah, some! I specifically look for second hand clothing because I want to be environmentally conscious, and there are some good deals on clothing that people only wear once or twice and want to get rid of!
This is true. Waste not want no I always say. I'm just glad the sun feels warm on my face again. Got any big fitness plans for the summer?
I'm definitely planning on training for a marathon this summer. It's been in my bucket list for a while, and I want to start now.
Nice. I may need to set some goals like that. It's been a while since I have felt motivated. A change in seasons helps though.
Would you consider joining me on my marathon training? The regimen also can be tweaked for shorter distances!
That sounds like a good Idea. I do write, but maybe I can start something for money
I would like to but I don't want to slow you down! How far do you run to train on avreage?
Have you been lowering your sugar intake?
Yeah! I bought a book called how to bake with less sugar, and it's given me lots of good ideas on how to use other sweeteners in my cooking as well.
Is the flavor different when you use a different sweetener?
I do have to admit, yes. But it's been great to use flavors that I don't mind, such as using honey in my tea or using fruits such as bananas in my smoothies. I end up using white sugar in my cooking because sometimes there's no great substitute, but I only use a small pinch.
I tried switching to diet soft drinks but I didn't enjoy the taste. Maybe I'll try eating more fruits to satisfy my sweet tooth instead fo grabbing another soft drink.
I think that's a great idea. Eating more fruits has definitely helped feel fuller too, so I've been able to watch my calories more easily too.
It's always good to drop a few pounds so you can show off when the weather gets warm
Yes. The elusive six pack may in the works as well. We will see!
Keep me posted. Coaching swimming keeps me in shape.
I mean, you said you like Stephen King. And Shawshank. I read that book. It was pretty boring. But it was also amazing. You never know what someone else might like to read. Also, doing stunts isn't always fun or exciting. Sometimes it is just falling off a roof and having to lay up for 7 weeks over a broken ankle. Nobody wants to hear about binge reading all of Jeff Wheelers books!
I think you should! There are many platforms out there where you could start to monetize your writing.
Does the pool that you use for coaching have public swimming hours? I would love to swim to help my fitness level!
They do, but its always packed. It's worth the extra money for a membership so you can get a lane to yourself if you go during the day.
I see. Yeah I don't want to be swimming when it's crowded with families and teenagers! Yuck!
My sister was just dancing and singing on songs from Frozen. I thought of you! She loves Elsa, do you?
I'm definitely more of a Team Anna person. I think her singing is just awesome. Especially "For the First Time in Forever" and "Do You Want to Build a Snowman"
I don't blame you, Anna is pretty cool too. Didn't you sing " Do You Want To Build a Snowman" for your Christmas concert last year?
Yeah that was me! Haha, that costume took ages to prep. My mom helped a ton to do that. I might do another Frozen song for the upcoming concert, but I haven't decided yet. The songs are so catchy but difficult to sing, don't you think?
Absolutely, I catch myself whistling the soundtrack more times than I'd like to admit! I can't wait to go to Disney and see all the characters in person, Mickey Mouse too!
Oh Disney World is really a magical place, as cliche as that sounds. I highly recommend you get the parkhopper tickets so you can visit all the parks, like the Animal Kingdom and Epcot!
I will certainly look into getting those, are they expensive for a big family? I really do hate waiting on lines though. I want to do the hot air balloon ride too! Are you scared of those?
You are right. maybe I will write a clueless sequel
They are expensive, for sure. But I think you they have annual deals that you can take advantage of. The flexibility and little to no waiting time is absolutely worth every penny. I'm definitely scared of heights, so I didn't go on the hot air balloon ride, haha!
See? My intuition is right again, i got that vibe from you, and they say psychics are phonies!
What! You guessed that I would be scared of heights? That's amazing. Can you teach someone how to read minds?
Yeah, something about you just says "Scared Of Heights" , can't put my finger on it but I just trust my gut! It's not really something you teach, you're born with it, but some people bloom later than others!
Oh boy, that's a bummer. I really wish I can read what my friends are thinking sometimes at school. But on a second thought, maybe that isn't such a good idea...
My dogs really uplift my mood whenever I am down. Just yesterday, I had a horrible day but just spending time with the dogs made everything good. Have you considered getting dogs to help you?
I would consider a dog but I don't know where to start.  What breeds should I consider?
You definitely don't want a breed that could get aggressive or that requires a considerable amount of training.  I find that golden retrievers, labs, and boxers are excellent companions.  I guess the other thing to think about is the size of the dog...would you want a smaller or more medium/large breed?
I would want one to keep in the house so it doesn't need to shed much.  I like the idea of a smaller dog but somewhat manly?  Andy idea of dogs based on that?
Hmm.  The smaller you go, the less "manly" the dog becomes, I think lol.  Daschunds are cute...so are beagles...but beagles tend to howl.
There are a lot of people out there who would read that! It's possible that you could get a publisher interested.
I wouldn't mind a beagle I guess.  Have you ever owned one?
I personally have not, but my grandmother did.  She let the poor thing get drastically overweight.  The beagle did howl quite a bit, which was a bit much to deal with at times...but she also didn't train him to not howl as much, so maybe that could be something you work on with the dog.
Well, I also live in a rural area, so the howling might not be as big of a deal.  I know you work.  I do too.  What do you do with your dogs while you are working?
I crate-trained the dogs early on, so when it is time for me to go to work, they head into their crate (it's quite large) and they stay in there until I get home.  Lucky for me, I work close to home, so I usually stop home for lunch, let the dogs out a bit to play and stretch, and then they go back in the crates until I'm done with work for the day.  Some people I know send their dogs to a doggie daycare.
Well, my job is boring.   But my boss might not care if I bring my dog to work with me.  He has a bird.  I would just have to work on the howling.  Did you train your dogs yourself or did you send them to obedience training?
Have you gotten a chance to watch the movie frozen yet?
Oh, I'm sorry - I completely forgot that you asked me to watch the movie last time we talked. I haven't watched it yet.
That's too bad! You must watch it soon. What city do you dream of living in?
I wish I could live in Calgary, which is in Alberta in Canada. I love being in nature, and going to Banff National Park regularly would be the dream!
That sounds cool! I don't know much about Canada yet. I think we may learn about it soon though.
I don't know if I could write in that genre. Maybe I could with your help since you are the bigger fan.
Yeah, maybe in your geography or history class you'll learn about Canada. It's a neighboring country to the United States, but they have many differences!
Can you meet Mickey Mouse there? If so, I'd like to go to Canada too!
Oh I'm sure you could. Mickey mouse is a global figure! I'm sure he visits Canada once in a while. What would you say to Mickey Mouse if and when you meet him?
Oh I don't know, I'd probably be to excited to even say anything or I'd be embarrassed.
Haha, that's understandable. But you should think about it! It's not everyday you get to meet someone that famous.
I will, maybe I can come up with something really cool to talk to him about. Now I'm excited just thinking about it.
I know, maybe you two can talk about the latest Disney movies and see what he thinks of them.
Did you sell any cars yet?
We were close, but the customer ended up not buying it. It was really disappointing.
I am sorry to hear that.  Are you and your wife getting a divorce?
I might be able to offer some tips haha. Since you love Friday, you might even think about writing about that!
Yes, I have a meeting with the lawyer after work. You won't believe how expensive these lawyers are! Hopefully we make a sale today so I can get my commission.
I have a friend at school and his parents are getting a divorce too.  He is going to live sometimes with his mom and sometimes with his dad.  If my parents got a divorce, I would be very sad. They only thing that would help is chocolate!
I hope your parents don't get a divorce! Do they get along well?
They argue sometimes but then they are happy together.  When they are mad at each other I tell them that we all should sing an ABC song. It always helps!
That's a really nice idea! Do you have any other favorite songs?
I also like Itsy Bitsy spider and Wheels on the Bus. Did you used to sing songs when you were 4 like me?
Yes, definitely! I always liked London Bridge and Brother John. Did you learn these songs at school?
My teacher thought it to us.  I really like cars. When I grow up I want to be a race car driver. Or maybe I can sell cars like you.
I think racing cars would be a lot more fun! Don't ever sell cars. It's impossible!
I just felt all three of my triplets kicking. It feels like I'm gonna have a soccer team!
I would love that. I just don't know if I can write that kind of humor. For books I have always been more into fantasy or mystery. I think I just need to start. Have you started a career knitting or is that a hobby?
How cool! I can't believe you are due in 90 days.  How does it feel?
Very bloated lol. I'm very ready to not be pregnant, honestly!
I can't even imagine what it feels like.  Is your family living close by? Are you going to have any help?
My mom is planning to help me a lot. I am single so it's going to be quite a handful.
I wish I could help you.  But I am starting college in two months.
Don't worry about it, you have enough on your hands! Do you find school to be difficult, or are you good at staying on top of everything?
Sometimes it is overwhelming but I push through it.  Riding horses helps me distress, they are the best therapy.
My fiancee made me chicken tacos the other night and they were delicious. Great idea, thank you.
You're welcome. What did you have in your tacos? I like using sour cream, avocado, salsa, cheese, lettuce and tomato in mine.
I had pico de gallo, guacamole, hot sauce, cheese and sour cream in mine. Those sound delicious! How was your day with Foxy?
It's turned into a full-time job! I started out selling items on the side, but demand eventually got to be so great that I was able to make it my main gig. I love it!
It sounds delicious! Foxy and I had a nice relaxing day. Have you gotten to the ocean lately?
That's great to hear! Yeah, yesterday I went to the ocean with my fiance and we had a blast!
That's awesome :) Did you guys do anything fun or just relax?
Mainly just relax, it was nice to watch the waves after not going for so long. Spending time with my fiance is the best, do you like to spend time with your sisters?
Relaxing is always a good thing. The waves must be very engaging to watch, especially with your fiance by your side. I love to spend time with my sisters. I would love to spend a day at the ocean with them.
I completely agree! It's one of the best feelings in the world. That'd be awesome, I know Alabama isn't anywhere near the ocean but maybe one day you could take a trip to the coast? It might be hard to bring 19 dogs though, lol
Maybe I can expand on your leaving the dogs with sisters idea. Take some of the sisters and leave the dogs with the others. Then do the other group another time :)
That's a great idea! I think both groups would appreciate the relaxation. I hope you can do that one day and tell me all about it! :)
Who doesn't like to relax, right?  How has Ohio State sports been going so far
So, a tip that might help you to get girls is to try to talk to them instead of whistling at them. For most girls, a guy whistling at them is very off putting.
that is my dream. I have a good career to fall back on, but selling stories on the side would be great.
I see.. I definitely won't whistle at them. How is your cat doing?
My cat is doing well! Thank you for asking. Hopefully approaching girls in calmer manner will help with your luck
I think it will. I'm going to try some of those dating apps to see if that will help. When is your mom coming to visit?
Dating apps may work out great. A great way to get to know someone. My mom is coming next week.
That sounds like fun. Does she have to go through any special protocols to get into the prison?
I will not be in prison when she visits. What type of girl are you looking for?
Someone down to earth, who doesn't mind camping and roughing it.
I am sure you can find her! And of course someone who likes your cats, right?
Of course! If she was allergic to cats, that would be a non-starter.
Do you want someone who wants to get married? Or have kids?
Haha I would think that being an ER doctor is pretty lucrative. You could also look into ghostwriting. There's a ton of demand for that.
Maybe, but not yet. I'd rather enjoy the world and travel a bit before I settle down. What about you?
Have you been mountain biking anywhere interesting lately?
Yes, actually. I went to a nearby trail and spent a few hours biking! It was so much fun! What is your favorite pair of shoe you own?
I have two brands of shoes that I tend to prefer. Jack Wolfskin and Oboz for their trail running shoes. They're a cross between a hiking boot and a running shoe. Super comfortable, waterproof, and durable.
Wow, interesting. I'll definitely have to check those out! Have you thought about getting a car so you don't have to bike to work or do you enjoy riding?
I have thought about it but I'm not sure it would pay off with savings in the end. I like vintage cars a lot. Do you mean vintage or modern cars?
I didn't have a specific type in mind. Wow, I really enjoy vintage cars too...preferably Chevy Trucks, like the 51' Apache or the 71' Chevy C10 Sidestep! Those are beautiful pieces of American made trucks!
I want a classic Ford, myself. I tend to be a Ford person, not a Chevy one. Either a '57-67 old truck, or a '67 Ford Mustang GT. I prefer cars that I can fix, today's are too computerized. I'm not sure buying one would pay off with work 2 blocks away.
You're so right about that, they make things to wear out faster and price things to high these days. I can see why now riding your bike is much more efficient! How convenient to be that close to you job! Guess what I did today? I went and tried out one of Starbucks Cinnamon Roll Frappuccino...it was fantastic! But I think their White Iced Mocha Frappuccino is my favorite!
That sounds fantastic! I love Starbucks but don't get it very often because it can be expensive. I love their Frappuccino's the most. I'll have to try the Cinnamon Roll one! I wonder if they have it at the shop near my home. Do you have other things you like there?
that maybe where I start. I'll get my feet wet that way. yes it is lucrative I make a good living, but I would like a job where I am not responsible whether someone lives or dies.
Oh yes, I love just about everything including their food selections. They have fantastic breakfast, they have a bacon gouda and egg sandwich that is just melts in your mouth! I tend to go to Starbucks to treat myself once every couple weeks. You're right it can be expensive. I am a nifty shopper and try to find coupons or discounts online before going. I meant to ask you, what kind of watches do you sell?
I usually buy gift cards when they're having bonus ones during the holiday season. Sometimes you can get $240 worth of gift cards there for $200 and such. I'm not as huge of a fan of their food, but I love trying all their drinks. I think the Refreshers are my favorite thing, along with the Cold Brew and the Frappuccinos. The new Kiwifruit/Starfruit Refresher is my new favorite. The Mango/Dragonfruit is a second.
I have seen the Mango/Dragonfruit but I haven't tried it. I have however, had the Kiwifruit/Starfruit Refresher it was pretty delicious! When Summertime comes I'll be interested in trying out the different refreshers.  I get in on those deals too, with the gift cards! I love free money!  I like gifting to friends and family too, they get excited when I share my good fortunes with them!
What's it like in Spain?
I have never been to Spain, i though you
How are you getting on with the algebra?
It is more in depth than regular math, where do you like to travel?
It is! I've been all over Europe and the East. Do you ever travel with your family? Other than thanksgiving at grama
Unfortunately no, maybe one day we will
Maybe you could go with Theda Thorpe one day?
What kind of dogs do you have?
I just found a really good survival hike competition it is for partners would you be interested in joining me my treat?
Yes if hed want to go with me, do you have kids of your own
How have sales been? Are your feet hurting from pounding the pavement?
I'm sorry I don't understand that metaphor, but if you are referring to my sales job as a salesman than yes. My feet don't hurt too much.
Yes, pounding the pavement refers to door to door sales but means sales in general. How do you balance your sales with your dog-walking job/
I try to sell my products to my customers while I walk the dogs. I meet people while walking and offer solutions to problems they might have while walking around the neighborhood. One product I offer my customers is fertilizer. I sell the fertilizer from the dogs I walk to people who have plants in their yards.
That's excessively clever! You're really created a synergy there. How about your personal life? Are you still seeing multiple people?
I do love connecting with multiple people as I feel more connected with the varying personalities of people. I like that people are so complicated from their wide range of interests and simple in how they feel about their interests. I'm addicted to people. So, yes, I am definitely seeing multiple people still. Thank you for asking.
Do you have any business partners in your dog-walking / fertilizer selling businesses?
My business partners are the dogs that I walk. I contribute a part of my income from that business to the parents of those dogs. This way they can afford food, healthcare and the occasional toy because they are so nice and good.
That's an interesting strategy. I didn't even know most people knew who the parents of their dogs are.
Heck yes I love hiking. I don't know if I would be able to win, but I for sure would love to do it. Do you think we can win?
The parents are the humans who take care of them. I'm sorry for not clarifying this for you earlier. I love these dogs. They are so smart.
Oh, OK. I though you meant literal biological parents. Have you ever gone for a walk with them and forgotten or run out of waste bags?
Sometime I do forget, but in moments like that, I just move the fertilizer toward the grass area. This way the fertilizer can help nearby plants.
Looks like your haircut went well! Where did you go?
I actually have a lady that does it in her own home. She is amazing, and I always tip her an extra 50 if I get 100 likes on social media in less than a week when she does it
Are you a social media influencer?
Me? I don't think so? Like I do post a lot of positive reviews of stuff and have a LOT of followers. But I do it as a hobby. Like I don't get paid or anything.
How long have you been doing this as a hobby?
Since Myspace was a thing I guess. I can take you to my hair dresser whenever you want to get some of it chopped off, and she can make you look like a whole new person. Referrals get 50% off their first cut/style
It sounds fun to have fans to interact with on social media. I am certainly interested in this referral. I wonder what style I should go with?
I think we've got as good a chance as any! Especially with a bit of training!
I wouldn't call them fans haha. More like people that like to get good info haha. like half my myspace friends followed me over to FB and twitter. What kind of style have you always wanted but feared trying?
I've always been afraid of cutting my hair really short. Whatever I do though I'd like to keep my bangs.
Really? Wow that is such an old style! I rarely see bangs anymore! Maybe after you get your hair done, I can post you on my page and do like a TBT type hype post to get people to go get some bangs and post selfies haha. That would be a blast
I know but I just can't help loving what I love. That sounds like a lot of fun! I'd love to be a part of it!
If you want, I can fwd my info and you can follow my pages to see what kind of responses I get before I plaster you on my wall. That way you will be ready for the possible contacts because it happens.
Do you think the theater you work at is hiring now?
I can ask next time I go for my shift. Have you applied to any other places recently?
Yeah, I tried to get into a local clinic, keep your fingers crossed! Or I could flip burgers lol
Lol! I'm sure it's not as hard as being a doctor, but a job is a job.
Yeah, the hospital cut back on staff for some stupid reason and since I only had 15 years in I was let go :( Maybe I will open a private practice, who knows?
that's true. How many days would this competition be?
That's rough but everything happens for a reason. A private practice sounds like a great idea. You can make your own hours, and have more time to watch UFC with me! :)
That would be awesome, I don't get a lot of TV time but the UFC sounds exciting lol
Yeah it's so exciting. Last night's fight was great. Total knockout in one round. You should definitely tune in next time.
I'll have to do that when my husband isn't hogging the TV haha He likes to watch his crime dramas after work
Lol yeah husbands tend to do that. You could always catch a movie instead, I can get you some free passes to the theatre. One of the perks of working there for so long.
That'd be great, I haven't been to the theater in a few years! I got to have nachos, though. I love nachos. It's not a movie theater experience without 'em
Oh, nachos are a necessity! The cheese dip we have is so good, you need to try it.
How have the horses been lately? Are you able to find some free time to study history?
They are very good and enjoying the warm weather, I like to read history as well but never visited Europe, what part of USA do you live?
I live in the west coast with near to pacific ocean, you should start thinking of travelling more to explore the world like Columbus.
Just a long weekend. Three nights, and the trophy is ours!
Well its a long time to my retirement so I would work hard to save money, how is the cruise trips like aren't you scared of the deep ocean?
The cruise is an amazing experience and you should try sometime.
I am more of a person of farmland and not been to ocean a lot, but I also live fish as a meal.
What type of fish you like as i like Salmon the most.
Where I live we get more of fish from the lakes or the river only.
Well its been a very nice day outside and I am again thinking to go to the beach and have some fun.
Well this is one of the benefit of living near the beach, so what part of Europe is best to visit?
I would say to visit the Italy and Rome as it has a lot of history associated to it and you will enjoy.
That is amazing as I always liked the Roman Empire and imagined how the structures are built.
I was telling the kids at the shelter about your pony and they wanted to ask if you could send a photo I could show them.
Let's do it. how is the gambling business going?
Of course. I've got tons of photos with the kids at the children's hospital riding on him. I wonder if the homeless shelter would let me bring the pony over one day.
So how do the children at the children's hospital like the mini pony?
They loved him. They laughed and giggled. Smiles all around... except for one shy little boy who wouldn't come close
That's awesome, and yes, I would love to see a photo!
I'll send over a few good ones once I'm back at my computer. How old are most of the kids at the shelter where you volunteer?
Most of the women there are teenagers.  They are homeless and pregnant.  I really enjoy working there.  I like to think I am making a difference.  I would imagine you feel the same with the kids where you volunteer.
I try to cheer up the kids, but I don't think I make any lasting impressions. Your work seems much more fulfilling.
I hope my work helps them.  So are you still wanting to become a lawyer?
Yeah. If only I won the lottery so I could afford the tuition...
Oh my goodness.  I can only imagine.  If I won the lottery, I think I would do some traveling.
Haha you know how they say the house always wins? My new nickname is The House.
Where would you like to go?
What was your first job as a teen.
My very first job was in a restaurant kitchen. Quickly learned it wasn't for me and got into music. What about you?
I actually didn't have a first job when I was younger. I have been into sports as long as I can remember.
Fair enough. How do you support yourself through sports?
I have been blessed to have parents that supported me. Sports helped me with scholarships for college. My parents were more interested in my education then me working.
That's good. I would have liked to have focused on my education but I needed to work to support myself.
That's unfortunate. I never took my opportunities for grants. Where do you work now?
I am currently working as a promoter for a few bands and artists. It is really fun.
That sounds awesome! I am happy to hear you are able to enjoy your job!
haha Love it. What do you play? or do you do sports betting?
Yes, I am fortunate enough to have a job I enjoy. There is nothing else than having to work a job you hate just to survive.
I can only imagine! I remember you saying you really like Aerosmith, got a favorite song by them?
I honestly don't think I could choose. They have so many good songs and albums. DO you have a favorite?
I just got back from a friend of mine. I told him earlier that knew someone looking for a restaurant job, and he says he knows of an opening for a line cook at a hotel here in Manhattan. Is that the kind of restaurant job you're looking for?
Oh wow that was fast, thank you! Did he say if he had any positions available for my sister? I'd hate to leave her behind.
Probably, I could ask him. I think he is hiring for a few different positions. I'll send you his details later today.
That would be awesome, she's always wanted to see NY too! How did you basketball game go btw?
I actually haven't played in a while becuase I've been studying for my exams. Hopefully I'll get a game at the weekend.
Oh sorry I thought you played every Friday, whoops! You better take your head out of the books and find some time to hang out with us when we get there!
Yeah I definitely will! Have you ever visited NY before?
I try to keep it diverse. I've been having a streak with Jai Alai, and horse betting is pretty lucrative. Poker is my game of choice.
Nope! Going to need someone to show us the ropes for sure. I hear people get robbed up there in broad daylight!
It's not as bad as people say although there are parts I wouldn't visit alone at night. I'll need to give you and your sister the tour.
I can't wait! I've lived here all my life, it's time for a change. Growing up I always had dreams of living in the big city, I even used to draw pictures of it that mom would hang on the fridge.
Well it is definitely a big city LOL You'll love it - we will have so much fun!
Oh boy, well as long as my phone stays charged i'll have a map lol! Is it easy to get a license up there? I've never had one here but i'd love to learn and I hear the city is an easy place to get started.
I was thinking about how you mentioned marathons. Do you ever do charity runs for cancer?
Yes, I got sponsored from my employer last year and we as a group were able to raiser over $5K!
Oh wow, that's so cool! I was thinking of organizing something like that at my school. Was it a lot of work to put together?
Last year I worked at the Cleveland Clinic hospital so getting sponsorship around healthy related items is quite easy.  Now, that I change job and work for a small insurance company, I think I have more work to get a sponsor.  If you were to get something organized at your school, what would you want to raise money for?
I was thinking maybe something to do with animals, possible a fund raiser for our local shelter. I think it could really help them out.
That sounds fun. Does playing the same game over and over get boring though?
Nice.  That is a worthy cause and one that I think your high school would support with open arms.  Speaking of animals, I know you an excellent horse rider, do you and your family own a horse farm?
I wish! I do have my own horse, but we have to board him at a place close to our house. I see him everyday, though. He's a great friend and riding partner. Do you have any pets?
I always wanted a horse when I was growing up but it was just too expensive for my family. Now, I have my super loving mini schnauzer to keep me happy.  Her name is Harper, she is all black, and just turned two years old.☺
That's awesome! I have a cousin named Harper, lol! Animals are the best!
Hey, I heard there is a new vegan restaurant that opened up last month in Fremont.  Maybe we can met there for dinner one day after your riding practice?   I hear they have some killer vegan tacos!
I'm down for that! I love checking out new places! Maybe you could pick me up from practice and that way you could meet my horse, maybe take a quick ride on him.
Awesome, I would love that.  How does next Saturday afternoon sound to you?  Maybe around 1:00 P.M.
Hey do  you have any  plan about  hiking ?
Well coming Summer I am planning to go to grand canyon as I hear a lot that hiking them is most hard, How's the weather in Washington now?
It is getting warmer day by day now, what type of Engineer you are?
One is a terrier and one is a sheep dog.   How long have you been volunteering?
Haha it's hard to get bored of winning! I could imagine that Blackjack and the slots could get pretty tiresome, hence why I avoid them.
I am a civil Engineer and like to construct unique buildings, a lot of finance involved as you may know well.
Oh yeah! I know when builders comes to get the loans from the bank for constructions.
So you like the BMW, I know these are some luxury cars and expensive to maintain isn't it?
Yeah you can say that as these are imported here and it makes sense to be expensive. which car you like?
I like Covette as it has a sporty look and love to speed on highways sometime
Yeah man it is really hard to control over the speed when you have a good car
So which bank you mainly work for? is it a National or domestic bank?
I work with more of Financial sector where we deal with the corporate only, its more or like a financial institution.
that is nice so what's your big plans for the summer?
Lets  go  to  theater to  watch a drama .
Yes. I enjoy blackjack, but I do prefer texas hold'em. If you could play one game for the rest of your life, what would it be?
Sure. Which drama did you have in mind?
Do you want something contemporary, or historic (like Ibsen?) I hear there's a modern remake of "Of Mice and Men".
No thanks. The movie Soul just came out last year. It's a movie made by Disney and Pixar. That movie is a nice drama around the life a music teacher. He likes playing his piano. I think we might both enjoy this.
Is that the one where he dies and goes to a limbo-y, heaven-y type place? It seems a bit lighthearted for a drama.
The drama part around this movie lies in the freedom of expression and the valuing of another individuals existence. The music teacher connecting with someone else and the ghost child's journey of self awareness.
That does sound a bit dramatic. A bit existential for Pixar, no? All right, I'll go. Maybe we can grab some Mexican beforehad.
Let's get rolled tacos and bring them into the theater while they are still warm. Theater food is expensive.
I agree that theater food is expensive, but there's no reason not to eat in a restaurant ahead of time.  Plus I'd like, maybe, to eat something harder to bring in the theater, like carnitas.
Carnitas are a legit vibe. Let's get extra guacamole with horchata because carbs aren't even a real thing.
You certainly don't mean Gucamole WITH horchta...that would be disgusting ... surely you mean, "guacamole and also get some horchata"  PS I don't like horchata. Too rice-y. But YASS to the extra guacamole!!!
I found a great new Mexican restaurant.
That's exactly what I mean. We vibe so well together.
Did you hear about the new country music concert that was just announced?
Will you get out of juvi in time? When is the concert?
Yes it is in Dec.  I am hoping my parents will let me go.  It is so close to where we live.  It is going to be in Austin.  Are you close enough to go?
I live outside of Dallas. Not too bad of a drive for Texas. Who is performing?
Keith Urban is one of them.  He is my favorite.  And Garth Brooks is going to make an appearance.  I'm so excited, but will be upset if I don't get to go.  Do you think you will go?
I will look into it later! I will check to see if I am free for that performance. I have most of my concerts lined up from now until September with a few already scheduled up until Jan. Hey, I've often wondered something about Juvi.. Do they feed you good food?\
No it is terrible!  Last night it was some kind of stew, but tasted horrible.  For breakfast we had oatmeal with a few strawberries.  The only thing good about it is we can have all we want.  I've gained weight in here.
I bet they offer a lot of carbs. What kind of foods are your favorite? I love just about anything
When I get out of here I'm ordering a pizza with pepperoni!  In here, the meatloaf is not too bad.  Do you like Pizza?
Oh yeah? What's it called?
Oh Yes! There is a pizza joint near hear that makes fantastic thin crust. They have a great sauce, I think I could drink it if they would give it to me in a glass. My favorite toppings are bacon and olives. Both black and green olives. Will your welcome home meal be Pizza?
That is what I'm hoping.  I just hope my parents get over being upset with me.  I'm here because my friend took us for a drive in his step mothers car without asking.  She reported it stolen and I hope they understand it wasn't my fault. But, I'm dreaming of pizza.  lol
That is tough! Do they have therapists and support groups in there that you can access ?
Tanning beds actually aren't bad for you if you don't overuse them. If you use them a moderate amount, you can actually protect yourself from being burned by the sun.
Do you know a specific brand or a specific salon that is guaranteed super safe and effective? I would like to try it. Ohh and a smoothie sounds good after all those pampering!
The one on 5th avenue is great ! There is also a smoothie bar nearby. What is your favorite flavor ?
I love strawberry and banana! Have you been to a Britney Spears concert?? I don't really like crowds, I would rather stay in and play xbox! But I think experiencing a concert is gonna be awesome!
Britney will come here in 4 months, I already bought my ticket, you should too if you want to go, they will be sold out soon.
Maybe its hard not to go if I'm with somebody. Do you mind if I tag along with you?
No, I would like you to come with me. It will be fun. We could have matching hairstyles, do you have any idea ?
It's called Tiny's Tacos. It's near the events center in my city. I got a quesadilla when I went there, and it was so good!
Sure! That's great. Do you have a boyfriend? We can double date! For the hairstyle we can go for the classic 90s look updo!
No I don't have a boyfriend, I broke up with him, he did not like to spend money.
Ahh thats ok! We can go by ourselves! Enjoy the evening with our matching hairstyles! I'm excited!
Yeah, but you should buy a ticket a soon as possible. Do you have enough money ? The tickets  are quite expensive.
Yeah I have enough money! I work a lot because I spend a lot. What kind of tickets did you get so I can buy the same
Wow. That's too nice. What type of hats do you collect?
I collect military hats. Are you patriotic?
Yes. I love this country even though I may not necessarily agree with everything the government does.
I am veryn proud of my hat collection. It took me many years to collect them all. Do you have many hats?
I have a few baseball caps that I like but I do not have many hats.
That sounds delicious! I've been eating Mexican food a lot recently, I never had it when I was younger so I feel deprived of it!
Are the MLB caps? What is your favorite team?
I have a couple but I don't know much about MLB. I like the Dodgers but I am a casual fan.
The Dodger won the world series last year. Good team to root for.
Yes I am happy they won. I'm from LA but I don't know much about baseball. I know more about basketball.
Do you sell many spoerts books at your bookstore?
There is a horror film festival this weekend, would you and your husband like to come with us?
I would love to! Is it nearby?
Yes! It would be on the weekend. Do you think you can spend the day off, I know you're busy in the hospital.
I think I could grab some time off. It's been awhile since I've been off, so they owe me some. Is it the whole weekend?
Yeah, Saturday and Sunday! We can all go either days and maybe have a drink in our newly renovated shed afterwards and just chill.
Yeah, eat it up!! Mexican is the best! What is your favorite dish so far?
All of that sounds great to me. When did you finish up the shed?
Last week, I just tried helping out my dad. He designed and mostly did the work. I have to take care of my kid so I didn't really have much time to help out. Do you think your husband can make it as well?
I don't seen why not. He doesn't work on the weekends, so he should be free. I think he'll be happy to get out of the house!
I'm really looking forward to it! Most of the horror movies I've seen there's always a detective involve, I might ask him some questions. This would be a good time off for all of us. By the way, is it your wedding anniversary soon?
It's late summer, so not right away, but also not far off. We were thinking of planning a getaway, but we've been so busy that we haven't finalized it yet.
A quick getaway is not so bad. You're going to be more busy when you have kids!
Yes, that much is for sure. We're finally starting to settle down, though, and I think that is not too far off!
I seen the Rolling Stones have announced a new tour recently, I'm going to book tickets.
That sounds amazing. I am not a huge fan but would love to go to a concert soon.
Oh really? I could have sworn you said you've been to a few concerts. I was going to grab you some tickets too. Ah well though. How have your kids been?
Tacos and quesadillas have been my go to! Everyone is really go though, I don't understand how my mom doesn't like it.
My mistake, I did say that. I am tired from taking the kids to all their activities and going to school. Ecomonics is a hard topic to study. How do you like your finance job?
Haha, I get it...They run you ragged sometimes. I remember how little sleep I got when I first had mine. It paid the bills and gave me something to do, I'm happy to be retired now though.
I look forward to retirement one day. I like the idea of getting to hang out with future grandchildren. Just hope my health is good enough by then to really enjoy it. Sorry to hear about your cancer. I am glad you beat it.
That was a process. Life is crazy when you look back at it sometimes. Made me pretty tired, but I'm just happy to be on the other side and to have got the support I did.
I am so happy to hear that. Now you have all the free time to spend with your grandchildren, and going to concerts you love. Silver lining right.
Yeah I can't complain. I'm happy with where I'm at, I wouldn't change how anything happened.
That is good to hear. Do you have any tips on how to succeed in finance?
Working for a living is a marathon not a sprint. Just show up and do your job, put in a decent amount of effort, but don't burn yourself out
That makes sense. I see a lot of people burn themselves out.
My friend is hosting a rooftop party next weekend, you are welcome to come along. It will be great fun!
Maybe she had a bad experience with bad food and never gave it a second chance. Maybe you should take her to lunch one day at a great place.
That sounds like fun!  Should I bring anything?  Food?  Beverages?
Bring your own alcohol if you want to drink!  We've got mixers and snacks, but you're welcome to add to them too if you'd like.  You can bring your boyfriend too!
Thanks so much for the invite!  We will be there!  How many people will be attending?
I'm thinking it'll be around 20 people.  It really depends on who shows up since we are inviting a few more than that who probably won't come.  It's gonna be a blast!
The weather will be great too!  Oh this will be fun!  Hey, how are your dog and cat doing?  I haven't asked about them in a while.
They've been doing very well!  I just got a new leash for my dog that's longer and more flexible and he loves it when we go on walks!  How has your new apartment been?
I love my new apartment!  It gets such great natural light which is fabulous.  However, I am not the best when it comes to decorating, so I'm having a bit of a hard time making the space my own...if that makes sense.
Yeah, that makes perfect sense to me.  I think that's a common thing with new places.  They look clean and sharp, but also a bit sterile.  It will take some time to make it feel more like a home.
I guess it just gives me more of an excuse to shop!  Haha!  How long have you lived in your place?
Haha, that's true! We've been here for 5 years now and it's just starting to feel like a home.  I think having pets helps, have you thought about getting a dog or a cat?
Yeah, that's true! I defiantly should because I think she would really enjoy it now.
I actually have been considering getting a cat!  I've always loved cats, and since they can be somewhat independent, I think they would be great for apartment living.  Did you get your cat from a shelter or from a pet store?
I found a stash of the comics I read whilst in hospital, I'm going to re-read them thanks to you!
Sorry to hear you were in the hospital. Glad to know at least you will have something fun to do during your downtime. Read comics while on the open water is the best though. I would highly recommend it next time you can.
Yeah, you know even though it was a rough time, I sort of remember it fondly because of all the comics. I think I'll start reading them more. They're just so much fun. Have you done any sailing or anything recently ?
I did. I was on the water last week. I ended up catching some great trout. I couldn't wait to get home and cook them up. What type of fish do you like to eat?
I like them all basically. Salmon is a great and reliable. But I like just about anything. Any recommendations ?
The rainbow trough is, especially, good but can sometimes be a pain to find. I try to eat healthy because I want to start running soon. Have you run any marathons lately?
Not for a few months. I'm training right now for a new one. My time is close to the last one but it's rough getting there.
I am sure. Running seems fun, but difficult when you are trying to train for longer distances. Is there any recommended training I should be doing to prepare myself.
Just be realistic with yourself. You're not going to go from not running to running a 5 minute mile. Running a mile at first is a big accomplishment, even if it's 10 minutes or something.
I have been volunteering for last 7 years
I don't see how anyone wouldn't! What types of flavors does she like, maybe I can recommend something. Does she like meats or vegetables more?
I understand that completely. I love celebrating the small wins. I have been feeling stressed lately, so I figured running would be a good outlet. As a life coach, what advice do you give your clients when they are stressed.
It's a great outlet for stress. Nothing makes me feel more calm and ready to take on a challenge than a workout. The best thing you can do is find a good outlet for stress and mix that in with your daily life.
That is some good advice. I do feel calm and more focused when I exercise. There are also the amazing health benefits too. Is it harder to run now, after beating cancer?  I am sure that takes a huge toll on the body.
Are you part of a team that compete in bike races or do you compete individually?
I compete individually I started doing it as a teenager. How many grandchildren do you have?
I have four currently with another on the way. It is such a joy to be able to spend time with them. They are all so sweet.
That's great to hear! By any chance, if one of them is interested in learning to ride bikes I would be happy to teach them.
I have a grandson who is getting to the age where he is taking the training wheels off and I think he would love that. He's a wild one, so I bet he'd love to learn.
Start them young! I can start teaching him as soon as he's out of training wheels. I hope I can meet your other grandchildren as well, you can bring them to the cafe I'm working at as a waiter. I would love to treat them to some hot choco.
I will bring them by the next time they stay over at my house for the weekend. They love getting out and about and meeting new people.
I would say meats more! She's really into Italian dishes.
That's great!! Let me know the next time they are over. What did you do after retirement?
For a while I just relaxed and got used to not working and spent a lot of time with family. I'm starting to think about new hobbies and getting into traveling now though. I just don't want to get bored.
Yeah its the time to relax and unwind. You remember me of my grandad, I should visit him soon and show him my red bike. I have a competition next time, and I want to invite you.
I would love to come! Just tell me when and where and I will be there!
I am super excited! I'll invite my grandad too. Maybe you guys can get along. He's also retired.
Say, can you play Semper Fidelis on the piano? I learned to play it on the wood blocks when I served!
I can!  We should play it together some time!  I bet it would sound amazing!  What other things did you learn how to do when you served?
I learned how to shoot guns and kill people from a long distance! I was a sniper! I think it would be great to play music together! What kind of folk songs could we play together?
I've always liked playing Hallelujah...do you know that song?
Yes, I love the version by that one guy... I could do a nice rendition of Hallelujah on the wood blocks I bet. What is that guy's name? Jeff something?
Maybe she should get something like arroz con pollo, rice with chicken. I get that a lot. It has a delicious sauce, and some good vegetables, also. The chicken is usually so tender and delicious!
Yes, Jeff Buckley.  Do you know the words?  I'd love to hear you sing along!
I love to sing. You can play the piano and I'll sing. Or should we duet? I'm looking forward to this!
A duet would be fun!  Although I'm sure your voice is better than mine haha!  But I'll certainly try my hardest!  Are you free this weekend?
Yes, we should grab lunch and then meet at your house to work on our songs. We could take this show on the road!
Perfect plan!  What type of food do you like to eat?
Well you know I love shawarma, but I love all middle eastern food. What about you? You pick! You're hosting this jam session at your house so you can choose the food!
I've never had shawarma, but I'd be open to trying it!  I'm always up to try new things!  I'm so excited for our get-together!
Hi Tanya, did you get used to your haircut yet?
Not really as I long my long hair just like you, so How is it to live in Manhattan?
Well I would say it is bit of Expensive but my parents can afford, I love to have pets but have not much space.
Yum, that sounds incredible! I'll suggest that to her and I may just have to get that for myslef.
You may need to move to a bigger hour for having dogs, how long is remaining for your college?
I am in final year and will pass out next year, so what kind of dogs you have?
I have two poodles and they are adorable, so whats the big plans after passing out?
Well keeping my field in practice and become a Stock Trader in NASDAQ, and can teach you some about the money.
That is so nice of you for the offer, as I am trying to loose some weight as well.
yeah so what type of exercise machine you have?
Well its a multi-training module and help me a lot to loose calories.
So why you get bored that makes you eat more, won't you have more activites to do?
Well the days are very long and I live alone so most of the time its very boring.
Hey how are you and your kids doing?  Howd the game end?
I have a softball tournament coming up.
Florida won! Thank goodness. My kids are great. My oldest son is playing football now!
Hi!  You must be so proud!  Remind me again.  Do you support University of Florida or Florida State University?
The University of Florida. Go Gators! What about you? Are you fan of football? Who do you root for?
Haha there's a saying here that Gators wear Jorts (jean shorts)!  I'm a fan of football, but English football.  Soccer.  I support Tottenham Hotspur!
Oh that's cool, I don't know anything about soccer. I mean football! Is Tottenham Hotspur a good team. And by the way we DO NOT wear jorts! Hahaha!
I mean...if I *had* to pick an American football team to cheer for, it would be UGA. GO DAWGS!  Fitting since I'm a farm boy from Georgia.  How's your weather down south today?  It's crazy humid here.
It's humid here too, as always! How does a farm boy from Georgia become a fan of Tottenham Hotspur?
Keen observation, my friend!  Self loathing perhaps?  Haha!  Truth be told...I think the name is fun to say :)  So where did you take the dogs on your walk earlier?
