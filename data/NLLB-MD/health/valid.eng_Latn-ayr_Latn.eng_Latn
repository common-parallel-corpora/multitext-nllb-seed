Good progress on the Sustainable Development Goals will bring further growth in life expectancy.
Its work accelerated in step with the Decade of Vaccines.
It has introduced the pentavalent vaccine to 68 countries since 2000, pneumococcal vaccine to 58, rotavirus vaccine to 43, and more.
Most recently, it has introduced the human papillomavirus vaccine – primarily to prevent cervical cancer in women – to four countries so far, following pilot projects in 27.
The authors of the Global Vaccine Action Plan, thinking of tuberculosis, influenza, and malaria, could not have envisaged the Ebola crisis.
But, with Ebola came a need and an opportunity to rapidly find a usable candidate vaccine.
WHO and its Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) rose to this challenge.
There was real innovation, in both technical and regulatory terms.
The lessons learned from this will hasten the development of other vaccines in the future.
WHO’s Strategic Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) was asked to monitor implementation of the Global Vaccine Action Plan, and report on this to the World Health Assembly.
Their successive reports have highlighted the residual problems of vaccine coverage: “There are still 19 million un-vaccinated and under-vaccinated children in the world, representing the least privileged members of society: those who are fleeing disaster, marginalized, dispossessed or simply uncounted”.
Taken together, the targets imply an overarching goal of reducing premature mortality.
Globally, since 2010, there has been no significant improvement in vaccination, as measured by DTP3.
In 2015, 68 countries were falling short of the mid-decade target of 90% coverage.
These percentages have flat-lined, or deteriorated, in more than 50 countries.
Variation in performance on this measure has persisted, both within and between countries.
Where delivery of vaccines is failing, it indicates weakness in the basics needed for a health system – a supply chain, simple management measures, training of staff, availability of frontline workers, and financing.
There are gaps in data availability and quality – a perennial theme in public health.
In turn, this holds back the quality of analysis needed to improve coverage.
Eradication has a special, but controversial, place in the field of immunization.
Smallpox eradication was a momentous public health achievement.
Over the last decade, considerable progress has been made towards eradicating polio.
When the Sustainable Development Goals were being developed, a number of prominent experts argued for such a goal to be made explicit and quantified, but it was not.
In 2007, there were 1315 cases in 12 countries; in 2016, there were just 37 cases in three countries.
But the “last mile” of polio eradication is taking far longer than anybody anticipated, when the 1988 World Health Assembly set off along this track.
Meanwhile, each WHO region has now set a goal of eliminating measles.
These are on different timelines, with 2020 the latest targeted date.
The step of converting these regional goals into a global eradication target has not been taken, largely because of the polio experience.
However, higher levels of measles vaccination have substantially contributed to the decade’s decreases in childhood mortality.
Vaccine financing is becoming increasingly contentious.
In 2015, the World Health Assembly passed a resolution on vaccine pricing, encouraging greater transparency and collective efforts from Member States.
It requested a series of actions from the WHO Secretariat.
The greatest concern surrounds countries “graduating from” Gavi (i.e.
Maintaining progress on maternal, childhood and communicable disease is of a somewhat different nature than achieving progress in the areas newly set out.
becoming ineligible for financial support), and also those middle-income countries that were never eligible for Gavi support.
The Decade of Vaccines has three years left to run.
The World Health Assembly is monitoring its progress annually.
The Global Vaccine Action Plan has reaffirmed that vaccines are a cornerstone of global health policy.
However, many of the children who need them most are still out of reach.
At the start of this decade, Melinda Gates, Co-Chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, made the case afresh: “Vaccines are a miracle,” she said, “With just a few doses, they can prevent deadly diseases for a lifetime.” This continuity of purpose must infuse the closing years of this decade and shape the years that follow.
The World Meteorological Organization confirmed that 2016 was the hottest year on record.
It combines data from a wide range of sources to produce its global and regional average annual temperatures.
Carbon dioxide and methane concentrations – both indicators of human-induced climate change – are at record levels.
Over the last decade, the United Nations, national governments, public health bodies, non-governmental organisations, civil society, scientific organisations, and the academic community have given unprecedented attention to climate change, to addressing ways to slow and mitigate its effect, and to reaching formal and binding international agreements.
Achieving the first, essentially the unfinished Millennium Development Goals agenda, cries out for tackling inequity in the provision of the most basic health services.
The majority continues to emphasise that it is the single dominant threat to the planet’s future.
This is reinforced by the judgments and reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
The Panel prepares comprehensive Assessment Reports about the state of scientific, technical and socio-economic knowledge on climate change, its causes, potential impacts and response strategies.
It also produces special reports, which are an assessment on a specific issue, and methodology reports, which provide practical guidelines for the preparation of greenhouse gas inventories.
The Fifth Assessment Report was released in 2013/2014.
Amongst the Panel’s key findings were the following summary conclusions: “Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions have increased since the pre-industrial era, driven largely by economic and population growth, and are now higher than ever.
This has led to atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide that are unprecedented in at least the last 800,000 years.
Their effects, together with those of other anthropogenic drivers, have been detected throughout the climate system and are extremely likely to have been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century.” and “Continued emission of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and long-lasting changes in all components of the climate system, increasing the likelihood of severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems.
Limiting climate change would require substantial and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions which, together with adaptation, can limit climate change risks.” Despite these clear and consistent conclusions, some continue to dispute that human factors have made a major contribution to climate change, and hold that current meteorological observations are not out of the ordinary.
Throughout the entire last decade of WHO’s work, climate change and its bearing on planetary health and human populations has been a towering backdrop.
Climate change has precipitated many extreme weather events with devastating effects for human settlements.
The leading diarrhoeal cause of death in the under-5s is rotavirus, and of death from pneumonia is pneumococcus.
Extensive work has been undertaken to scope, document, and model the specific health effects of climate change.
These include: a greater risk of injury, disease or death from extreme weather events (such as prolonged heat waves and major floods); greater transmission of vector- and water-borne diseases as well as zoonoses; poor air quality causing cardiac and respiratory illness; reduction in levels of safe drinking water; adverse effects of exposure to ultraviolet light; malnutrition due to poor crop yield; and, social and economic impacts on mental health and well-being.
WHO estimates that, between 2030 and 2050, climate change will cause approximately 250,000 additional deaths per year, from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhoea and heat stress.
The direct damage costs to health (i.e.
excluding costs in health-determining sectors such as agriculture and water and sanitation) is estimated to be US$ 2-4 billion per year by 2030.
Since a landmark resolution by Member States in 2008, WHO has developed and implemented workplans to prevent and mitigate the health effects of climate change.
The latest, endorsed in 2015, covers: • Partnerships: to coordinate with partner agencies within the UN system, and ensure that health is properly represented in the climate change agenda • Awareness raising: to provide and disseminate information on the threats that climate change presents to human health, and opportunities to promote health while cutting carbon emissions • Science and evidence: to coordinate reviews of the scientific evidence on the links between climate change and health, and develop a global research agenda • Supporting the public health response: to assist countries to build capacity to reduce health vulnerability to climate change, and promote health while reducing carbon emissions.
Building on this, a broader action agenda for the whole health community was agreed at the 2016 WHO Conference on Health and Climate.
In 2015, The Lancet Commission on Health and Climate Change produced a series of reports and papers on the health aspects of climate change and the potential response which it described as “the greatest global health opportunity of the 21st century”.
The Commission, and indeed other global health panels established by The Lancet medical journal, are an excellent example of how independent groups of scientists, experts, and thought-leaders, are indispensable to advancing global health.
Both are vaccine-preventable.
In this case, The Lancet Commission on Health and Climate Change made a series of policy proposals and pledged to monitor progress on them: • Invest in climate change and public health research, monitoring, and surveillance • Scale-up financing for climate-resilient health systems worldwide.
This must enable the strengthening of health systems in low- and middle-income countries, and reduce the environmental impact of health care • Protect cardiovascular and respiratory health by ensuring a rapid phase out of coal from the global energy mix • Encourage a transition to cities that support and promote lifestyles that are healthy for the individual and for the planet • Establish the framework for a strong, predictable, and international carbon pricing mechanism • Rapidly expand access to renewable energy in low- and middle-income countries, thus providing reliable electricity for communities and health facilities; unlocking substantial economic gains; and promoting health equity • Support accurate quantification of the avoided burden of disease, reduced health-care costs, and enhanced economic productivity associated with climate change mitigation • Adopt collaborative mechanisms between Ministries of Health and other government departments, ensuring integration of health and climate considerations in government-wide strategies • Agree and implement an international agreement that supports countries in transitioning to a low-carbon economy.
Many of the same unsustainable and polluting technologies that are driving climate change also contribute to the more immediate and local threat of air pollution.
In March 2017, speaking to the BBC, Dr Margaret Chan, Director-General of WHO, said: “Air pollution is one of the most pernicious threats facing global public health today and on a bigger scale than HIV or Ebola.” WHO has estimated that 92% of the world is breathing air above the limit for levels of particulate matter.
Called PM2.5, these particles have a diameter less than 2.5 micrometres, or one seventh of that of a human hair.
For this reason they can travel deep into the lungs.
Together with carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide and ozone, small and ultrafine particles are the most damaging components of polluted outdoor air.
WHO has estimated that poor indoor and outdoor air quality kills around seven million people a year, with the highest number in Asia.
Air pollution has an impact on health right across the life course, having been causally linked to low birth-weight, acute and chronic lung disease, stroke, dementia, coronary heart disease, cancer, as well as damage to DNA and the immune system.
The impact on children is particularly marked - every year, nearly 600 thousand children aged under 5 years die from respiratory infections attributable to indoor and outdoor air pollution and second-hand smoke.
Water and sanitation, nutrition, and contraceptive access remain current and critical issues.
Between 2008 and 2013, global urban air pollution levels rose by 8%, although there were improvements in some regions.
The sources of outdoor air pollution are diverse: energy use in domestic and commercial settings traffic (particularly diesel engines); farming; power generation; industrial outputs; burning of living and dead vegetation (e.g.
in land clearance).
Additional sources of poor outdoor pollution in some parts of the world include sand and dust storms from deserts and deforested areas.
Indoor air pollution is also important in causing premature death, illness, and poor health across the world.
WHO estimates that it kills 4.3 million people a year.
At the World Health Assembly in May 2016, a Road Map for An Enhanced Global Response to the Adverse Health Effects of Air Pollution was adopted, covering actions to be taken between 2016 and 2019.
It sets out four areas of action.
Firstly, to expand the knowledge base in respect of evidence on the impact on health of air pollution, and the effectiveness of policies to prevent and mitigate them.
Secondly, to develop better monitoring and reporting systems, and measures of progress towards the air pollution-related targets of the Sustainable Development Goals.
To populations in richer countries, these seem absolutely the basics.
Thirdly, it seeks to design approaches to leverage health sector leadership and coordinated action at local, national, regional and global levels in order to raise awareness of air pollution.
Fourthly, the Road Map aims to strengthen institutional capacity of the health sector to analyse policy and decision-making in support of joint action on air pollution and health.
The emphasis in the Road Map is on securing multi-sectoral engagement across transport, energy, waste management, agriculture, urban planning, and industry.
The importance of the core human needs of water (for drinking, bathing, and household uses), sanitation (access to toilets, safe disposal of solid waste), and hygiene have risen up the global health agenda over the last decade.
Populations in the poorest parts of the world suffer badly from the lack of these basics.
Safe water for drinking was a Millennium Development Goal target and was one of the first to be met.
However, the situation is still very serious as the United Nations data show: • 2.6 billion people have gained access to improved drinking water sources since 1990, but 663 million people are still without • At least 1.8 billion people globally use a source of drinking water that is faecally contaminated • Water scarcity affects more than 40 per cent of the global population and is projected to rise • Over 1.7 billion people are currently living in river basins where water use exceeds recharge • 2.4 billion people lack access to basic sanitation services, such as toilets or latrines • More than 80 per cent of wastewater resulting from human activities is discharged into rivers or sea without any pollution removal • Each day, nearly 1,000 children die due to preventable water and sanitation-related diarrhoeal diseases • Floods and other water-related disasters account for 70 per cent of all deaths related to natural disasters.
The Sustainable Development Goals take a broad-based approach.
Goal 6 states: “Ensure access to water and sanitation for all.” Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) is now part of many global health programmes, notably those run by a wide range of non-governmental organisations.
Particular expertise is needed in delivering such programmes at times of floods and other extreme weather events as well as in refugee and migrant camps and settlements.
But the basics are not yet available for all.
Toxic land pollution is another route through which health is damaged.
Many people in poorer communities in low- and middle-income countries can come into contact with toxic compounds.
This happens in a number of ways.
They may be living near, or on, an abandoned industrial site where heavy metals and other hazardous substances can stay in the soil for years, or even decades.
Children playing in such environments are particularly vulnerable.
A greater and concerted international effort is needed to clean up these sites but also to assess the risks more comprehensively, educate and inform the communities affected, and find creative ways to provide alternative employment.
There have been some encouraging programmes.
For example, in a $25 million program, the World Bank has removed over 3,000 tons of obsolete and dangerous pesticides from around 900 contaminated sites in Ethiopia, Mali, Tanzania, Tunisia and South Africa.
Soil contamination is just one of the many ways in which health is harmed by exposure to hazardous chemicals.
The dangers remain too commonplace in the workplace, the home, and even in schools.
Very little is basic either about the areas of newer focus, primarily noncommunicable disease.
The hazards exist in all countries, but are often more marked in poorer countries.
People may visit sites with industrial waste to try to harvest anything of value to provide a small income.
Increasingly, this can include so-called e-waste where discarded electronic products are broken apart, again exposing someone to toxins, including lead.
They may work in unregulated or exploitative industries with no safeguards or protection for workers.
Or, they may try to make a living through a hazardous process such as battery recycling or attempting to extract gold using mercury.
In such circumstances, levels of knowledge or awareness of the dangers are usually very low.
These are examples drawn from a wide spectrum of hazards.
Drawing on expert opinion, WHO has estimated that over 12 million people die each year from exposure to hazards of all kinds in the environment.
A roadmap for how the health sector can address chemical concerns will be considered by the World Health Assembly in 2017.
The Ancient Greek physician, Hippocrates, wrote On Airs, Waters, and Places.
At a macro- and policy-level, prevention needs political courage and multi-sectoral collaboration.
He was one of the first to speculate that the quality of air, water, and soil as well as climatic conditions was likely to have a strong influence on health.
Nearly 2500 years later, concerns about the impact of climate and environment on health are still centre stage.
WHO’s global health leadership role comes to greatest public prominence at times when outbreaks or epidemics of communicable disease pose a serious international threat.
This can be because of the novel nature of the infectious agent, the scale and speed of transmission, or the severity and consequences of the resulting illness.
The 21st Century began with just such an emergency, when a respiratory virus that had not previously caused widespread human illness struck with a force that precipitated a global crisis.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) caused massive economic and social upheaval and threw a critical spotlight on national and international public health systems.
By the time the disease had run its course, it had been reported from 29 countries and areas, there had been more than 8000 cases, and nearly 800 people had died.
SARS triggered many fundamental reviews of public health capacity and capability, particularly in countries such as China and Canada that had been worst affected.
It also led to the broadening of the International Health Regulations, which now cover a wide range of risks and represent a major agreement between 196 countries to work together to protect global health.
Many key lessons came out of the experience of SARS, including: the need for early sharing of surveillance data between countries and with WHO; getting virus isolates to specialist laboratories as quickly as possible; and, strong global coordination of response.
The delivery of primary prevention through healthcare systems requires those systems to have a fair degree of sophistication; secondary prevention and other treatment requires this even more so.
Central to the future was recognition of the importance of the leadership role of WHO.
Much of this learning was invaluable for the public health emergencies that were to dominate the succeeding period, notably pandemic influenza, Ebola virus disease, and Zika virus.
However, each brought a new set of challenges.
In the 20th Century, there had been three well documented influenza pandemics (1918, 1957, and 1968) causing up to 100 million deaths.
By 2007, pandemic influenza planning was intensive, because: 40 years had passed since the last pandemic; there had been alarming outbreaks of “bird ‘flu” with human cases; and, there was worldwide infection of wild and domesticated bird populations with H5N1 influenza virus, with such viruses having high propensity to re-assortment.
In March 2009, a new influenza virus emerged in Mexico (initially described as “swine ‘flu”) with early reports suggesting a case fatality rate of 64%.
Had this virulence been borne out by further evidence, it would have been catastrophic to the world’s population.
The subsequent course of the influenza A [H1N1] pdm09 virus pandemic, the first for 40 years, made it one of the mildest on record.
The figure of an estimated 105,700 to 395,000 deaths globally is certainly much less than the three 20th Century pandemics, and more comparable to seasonal influenza mortality.
However, what was largely overlooked by many commentators was that it killed a disproportionate number of children and young adults.
During 2015, more people became refugees than at any time since the Second World War.
This was typical of an influenza virus “shift” and not of seasonal ‘flu.
Had the world’s public health services left their extensive pandemic plans on the shelves, and shrugged their shoulders that the effort would not be worthwhile, then more children and young adults would surely have died.
To an epidemiological eye, the numbers would still have been small, but that is of little comfort to the mother or father of a dead child.
Public perceptions of risk are very different to those of 40 years ago and clusters of children’s deaths and the hospitalization of young people are not readily accepted in a rationale of “mildness.” At WHO, strong pandemic plans were in place and these were implemented.
The eventual outcome could not have been reliably forecast.
In the event, the 2009 H1N1 pandemic was invaluable as a “dress rehearsal” for a more severe future pandemic.
It was the first test of the 2005 International Health Regulations.
The independent review of the pandemic response concluded that some things had gone well, notably: the early identification and characterisation of the Reported intensive natural hazards in Africa Number of disasters virus, the provision of candidate vaccine strains, and the creation of strong collaborative networks to help manage the pandemic.
Other areas were criticized, for example: the slow distribution of the vaccine; the inadequate vaccine production capacity (that could only provide for a third of the world’s population); the weakness of the definition of a pandemic that relied purely on the scale of spread, not severity, leading to public announcements that lacked credibility; the absence of transparency about membership of scientific advisory committees and perceived conflicts of interest.
Recommendations were made to strengthen the approach for the future.
There are now 21 million refugees.
One of the most important actions should be to drive research harder for a pluripotent influenza vaccine that could block the prospect of a future influenza pandemic.
The transformative nature of this to save millions of lives in a severe pandemic has not been fully appreciated.
Perhaps the global health community is allowing themselves to believe that influenza pandemics come in 40-year cycles.
The reality, of course, is that a novel, easily transmitted, and highly virulent influenza virus could emerge next week.
One of the most important aspects of the SARS crisis was the extent to which the outbreaks moved dangerously out of control once infections were treated within hospitals, if prevention and control standards were weak.
Whilst this was understood at the time, the need to look more generally and critically at the risks within healthcare facilities especially in low-income countries was not systematically addressed.
In 2014, Ebola virus disease, an infection with a high case fatality, began to surge in larger conurbations in three countries in West Africa: Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia.
Outbreaks in other neighboring countries, Mali, Nigeria and Senegal, were rapidly controlled.
The outbreaks in the three main countries were prolonged beyond anything that had been seen before.
Previously Ebola had only ever occurred in sparsely populated areas and as a result been contained.
All these factors have had a major bearing on the health and wellbeing of nations and communities, particularly those in the poorest parts of the world.
This has been a hugely adverse trend.
This time it emerged in settings with poor healthcare infrastructure, and significant gaps in infection prevention and control procedures.
There was no early intervention.
As a result, it posed a much greater threat to regional populations and potentially globally.
WHO was criticized for its slow initial response to the threat of Ebola.
After a difficult start, the response got stronger - thanks both to WHO and to many of its partners.
There were three strong features of the response.
Firstly, a public health Emergency Operations Centre that had been created by WHO and other Polio Partners for the purpose of coordinating action to eradicate polio in Nigeria was immediately and successfully deployed against Ebola.
It is widely accepted that had Ebola been allowed to spread into densely populated Lagos, Nigeria, the world could have been tipped into a public health catastrophe.
Secondly, the team in WHO that led the first Global Patient Safety Challenge, Clean Care is Safer Care, had developed a very strong capability in healthcare infection prevention and control, together with extensive experience of implementation in low-resource settings and a wide network of international experts.
This team joined forces with other infection control experts in WHO.
The number of refugees has grown by more than 40% over just three years, largely from the Syrian Arab Republic.
It was given the mandate to coordinate efforts and also deployed in the affected areas to help reduce risks and strengthen resilience in the affected countries.
Thirdly, WHO and partners forged a strong multinational alliance of Member States, international agencies, donors, and NGOs to coordinate action and provide the necessary support in funding, expertise, personnel, and supplies.
The Ebola epidemic was declared over on 14th January 2016.
The official figure for deaths was 11,315 but the true figure will be much higher.
The Review Committee on the Role of the International Health Regulations (2005) in the Ebola Outbreak and Response reported to the World Health Assembly in 2016.
It noted that many of the recommendations from the earlier review of the pandemic response (2011) had not been fully implemented.
This meant that the world was still ill-prepared and vulnerable when Ebola struck.
The 2016 recommendations therefore focused on the need to ensure full implementation of the International Health Regulations with all that this would entail.
Critically, it was recognized that improvements sought, including substantial capacity building, would require a multi-sectoral approach.
In addition, significantly greater funding would be required.
In addition, some 40 million people are now internally displaced.
WHO has been leading programmes of work to build resilience in healthcare systems post-Ebola.
Subject to the availability of the necessary financial support, WHO will be able to provide the urgent help needed to address poor infrastructure and limited implementation of infection prevention and control practices, and quality of care principles.
Evidence is also emerging that the delivery of essential maternal and child health services – such as antenatal care and immunization – has reduced since the Ebola epidemic was declared over.
WHO is helping countries to assess their International Health Regulations core capacities.
These capacities form an essential platform for the detection, assessment, notification and reporting of events, and for the response to health risks and emergencies of international concern.
A programme of Joint External Evaluations is assessing countries’ capacity to prevent, detect and respond to public health risks, highlighting the most critical gaps.
The improvements that will flow from the post-Ebola reforms of WHO will have the dual benefit of preparing countries better to face the next new disease, and also the current killers.
Major outbreaks of communicable disease over the last few years have included: avian influenza A (H7N9) in China; plague in Madagascar; Yellow Fever in Brazil, Angola, Democratic Republic of Congo and Uganda; MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia; Hepatitis E in Chad; Seoul virus in the United States of America and Canada; meningococcal disease in Togo; and Lassa Fever in West Africa.
The frequency and severity of these events not only emphasizes the need for strong public health in countries, but the need for WHO’s role in global coordination and response.
A further important post-Ebola development is the new African Union-funded Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
They no longer have a stable home but remain within the borders of their own country.
It became operational on 31 January 2017.
It will play a pivotal role in helping the continent respond to public health emergencies.
The plans include regional centres across the continent – Kenya, Zambia, Egypt, Gabon and Nigeria.
The work of Africa Centers for Disease Control will surely enhance understanding of the higher risk populations in Africa, and advise on what prevention and control measures are necessary to provide better protection.
WHO has broadened its perspective from major outbreak and pandemic preparedness, to a wider concept of public health emergencies.
Understanding and responding to the direct and indirect impact of disasters and humanitarian crises on health is advancing.
The United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (ISDR) was established in 1999, mandated by a United Nations General Assembly resolution (56/195), to serve as the focal point in the United Nations system for the coordination of disaster reduction.
It ensures synergies among the disaster reduction activities of the United Nations system and regional organizations and activities in socio-economic and humanitarian fields.
It received nearly 350 reports of disasters from across the world in 2015.
They caused over 22,000 deaths, affecting 98.6 million people, and resulting in $66.5 billion in economic damage.
Two-thirds of the world’s refugees and half of its internally displaced people are in the Eastern Mediterranean region.
Closely linked to its work is The Sendai Framework.
This is a crucial development.
It is a United Nations initiative to address disasters, bringing together public health and disaster risk reduction.
It is part of the so-called “all-hazards” approach, and aims to reduce disaster risk and associated losses of lives, livelihoods, and health.
WHO is not only involved in public health emergencies, but in the health elements of natural disasters (such as the Nepal earthquake) and complex humanitarian situations (such as in Syria and Iraq).
The building blocks of its approach include an Early Warning and Response Network (EWARN), a Health Resources Availability Monitoring System (HeRAMS), and an Emergency Medical Teams initiative.
It has an increasing leadership role in the Inter Agency Standing Committee, particularly for infectious hazards.
WHO’s new Health Emergencies Programme is changing the way WHO works with countries to respond to crises and emergencies, from being primarily a technical agency, producing norms and standards, to a fully operational agency.
The Programme has five technical and operational divisions: • Infectious hazards management: to ensure strategies and capacities are established for priority high-threat infectious hazards.
• Country health emergency preparedness and the International Health Regulations (2005): to ensure country capacities are established for all-hazards emergency risk management.
This forced displacement is a small fraction of the total number of migrants worldwide, which now stands at 244 million.
• Health emergency information and risk assessments: to provide timely and authoritative situation analysis, risk assessment and response monitoring for all major health threats and events.
• Emergency operations: to ensure emergency-affected populations have access to an essential package of life-saving health services.
• Emergency core services: to ensure WHO emergency operations are rapidly and sustainably financed and staffed.
This is a very big shift of emphasis, and expansion of role, for WHO.
The Programme works with countries and partners to prepare for, prevent, respond to and recover from all hazards that create health emergencies, including disasters and conflicts as well as the traditional locus in disease outbreaks and conflicts.
The Programme will also lead and coordinate the international health response to provide effective relief and recovery to affected people.
In reviewing some of the challenges, developments, intractable problems, crises, emergencies, and successes in global health over the last decade, the words “One World” seem to float high above a complex landscape of global and national health architecture.
Within it, so many dedicated individuals, teams, and organisations work tirelessly, as the sun rises and sets in the 24 different time zones of the world, to bring the gifts of good health, longevity, well-being, and the relief of suffering to seven billion people.
One World reverberates in many of the goals of global health: Universal Health Coverage; Every Woman, Every Child; access to essential life-saving medicines.
The two words echo in the aim of “One WHO”, in which Member States, regional and country offices, global partners, NGOs, and civil society seek to strike a common purpose.
The level of international migration has remained constant – at between three and four percent of the total global population – for several decades now.
They are unavoidable when thinking of the assailants on the world’s health: climate change, pandemics, natural disaster, conflict, antimicrobial resistance.
They inspire solidarity, compassion, and idealism when the statistics of health and poverty, health inequity, life and death are on the table or projected on the screen.
They are relevant, too, when discussions turn to the need for alignment and collaboration between: science and policy; public and private; national and local.
WHO and its Director-General have powerful roles in creating and sustaining this holistic view of global health and in trying to forge a broad-based coalition to lead the quest to make lives healthier, fairer, and safer.
The power of WHO is delivered through its roles in leadership, technical expertise, standard-setting, coordination, facilitation, and influencing agendas on the global stage.
Looking back over the last decade, it is clear that the world’s health needs are so diverse and urgent, that WHO cannot simply concentrate on a small number of priorities as some would advocate.
This is demonstrated by the breadth of areas in which progress in global health has been made over the last decade, by organisations and individuals working at global, national, and local level in partnership with WHO and often in response to its leadership.
This Report documents many of the achievements of the last decade, for example: improved outcomes for mothers and children, breakthroughs in vaccine provision, two diseases brought to the brink of extinction, reductions in deaths from the major killers, measures to halt the rise of noncommunicable diseases, new frameworks and structures for public health emergencies (building on the learning from pandemic influenza and the Ebola virus crisis).
Serious problems and challenges remain, many centered on the sources of inequity and on the burden of disease, premature death and disability suffered by the poorest populations in the world.
Looking across all these fields in which gains in global health have been made, a number of important themes stand out.
Refugees and internally displaced persons can face extreme health threats.
On occasion throughout its history, WHO has launched big ideas that have transformed policy-making, inspired major initiatives, and continued to shape action at global and country level over years and sometimes decades.
A good example of this is Dr.
Halfden Mahler’s vision of Health for All that he set out in 1981.
Dr.
Mahler was Director-General of WHO between 1973 and 1983.
He died, aged 93 years, in December 2016, when WHO staff mourned his passing and celebrated his life and achievements.
When he spoke about his idea in 1981, Dr.
Mahler said: “Health For All means that health is to be brought within reach of everyone in a given country.
And by ‘health’ is meant a personal state of well-being, not just the availability of health services – a state of health that enables a person to lead a socially and economically productive life.
Health For All implies the removal of the obstacles to health – that is to say, the elimination of malnutrition, ignorance, contaminated drinking water and unhygienic housing – quite as much as it does the solution of purely medical problems such as a lack of doctors, hospital beds, drugs and vaccines.” The role of WHO in thought leadership is not often talked about.
Their suffering includes: violence, torture, rape and sexual exploitation, slavery, and mental illness.
When ideas like Health for All emerge, they are not mere slogans.
They are powerful forces for change.
They can become an organising principle for global health.
Often, too, they are underpinned by a strong moral rationale: in this case, health as a human right.
In her leadership of WHO, Dr.
Margaret Chan has continued this focus on the fundamentals.
At a number of points in the last decade, WHO has called on the world to see health through a different lens, not just with a focus on disease.
One was the Commission on the Social Determinants of Health that WHO established and subsequently championed.
Almost immediately after publication, the Commission’s report began to influence thinking and shape the health agenda.
It has cascaded through regions and countries, challenging those who review existing policies and plans to think differently.
The wider group of migrants also faces social economic and health disadvantage, though usually less severe (for example, barriers in access to services, as well the challenges of a new language and culture).
A second was the idea of Universal Health Coverage.
This is fundamental in nature, and driven by strong emphasis on social justice, equity, and compassion.
A third was equally transformative but in a different way.
The World Report on Ageing and Health, and its companion implementation plan, The Global Strategy and Action Plan on Ageing and Health, set out a vision of the future not just for health and healthcare, but one with the potential to strengthen the very fabric of societies, to buoy economies, to transform the nature of cities, and to promote the cohesion of generations.
Shifting the world of tomorrow from unhealthy to healthy ageing is as profound a goal as any international agency has ever set.
Moreover, the do-nothing option will be disastrous.
A fourth watershed moment for global health was the first Global Report on Disability.
Professor Stephen Hawking said in the foreword: “In fact, we have a moral duty to remove the barriers to participation, and to invest sufficient funding and expertise to unlock the vast potential of people with disabilities.
Governments throughout the world can no longer overlook the hundreds of millions of people with disabilities who are denied access to health, rehabilitation, support, education and employment, and never get the chance to shine.” The Report gave clear global guidance on how to take action on the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
About 15% of the world’s population lives with some form of disability.
WHO works in partnership to achieve its goals.
In 2008, the World Health Assembly put the issue of migrant health firmly on the agenda, with a resolution calling on both Member States and the WHO secretariat to act.
WHO has a distinguished tradition in the classification and measurement of disability, but much of this past work was based on a medical perspective.
The Global Report on Disability, released in 2011 (jointly with the World Bank), shifted the paradigm of disability within the global health arena.
It set out a vision of a social model of disability.
Here, disability is seen as arising as an interaction between people and their environments.
The emphasis is on breaking down barriers that prevent inclusion.
With these four foundational areas of work, WHO is helping not only to inspire action to achieve better health but to shape the way that health should be viewed in the future.
It is also seeking to reinforce the fundamental values that underpin it.
These key policies will also provide a powerful stimulus to think differently about the way that health systems are designed and delivered.
They will also create a vital backdrop to public policy-making more generally within countries.
In the past, WHO, as one of the main United Nations specialist agencies, has worked on its own agendas.
The Director-General was asked “to promote migrants’ health on the international health agenda, in collaboration with other relevant organisations”.
Health was infrequently part of main United Nations business at the highest level.
In the past decade, there has been an unprecedented scale of engagement of the United Nations in global health.
In September 2011, a High-Level meeting of the General Assembly of the United Nations made a Political Declaration on the Prevention and Control of Non-Communicable Diseases.
In June 2011, a similar declaration from a High-Level meeting called on Member States to intensify efforts to eliminate HIV and AIDS.
In December 2012, the United Nations General Assembly passed a Resolution on Universal Health Coverage.
In December 2016, the United Nations Member States signed a declaration to combat Antimicrobial Resistance.
In 2014, the United Nations General Assembly and the Security Council discussed the Ebola crisis and authorized a wide range of actions.
The importance of gaining United Nations commitment to global health priorities is of immense significance.
It moves them from being solely programmes within the health sector to formal commitments that presidents and prime ministers take ownership of and accountability for.
It has also been significant that global health has increasingly been part of the discussions of the G7 and G20 groups of nations.
Over the subsequent years, the needs of migrants have become increasingly considered in WHO policies, plans and programmes, notably in approaches to HIV, tuberculosis, mothers and children, and reproductive health.
The overarching nature of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals is another vital part of this agenda.
There are 17 universal goals, 169 targets, and 230 indicators.
It is still early days for implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals.
The examination of the health-related goals, targets, and indicators is just beginning.
They have the potential to be transformative in global health.
It will be essential to decide to what degree future priorities should be only in the currency of the Sustainable Development Goals, and how much they have to be driven forward in a different way.
Over the last decade, WHO has initiated its own process of reform, discussing it with its Member States, partners, and a wide range of individuals and organisations.
Some of the debate has focused on first principles: what should a global health body, made up of all countries of the world, actually do? The complexity of the global health landscape is one the main drivers of the need for WHO to re-examine its own role and positioning.
The number of organisations and interests has increased and, as a result, mapping out inter-relationships is a constant work-in-progress.
Also there has been a worsening of the funding climate for WHO’s work, particularly in the aftermath of the global financial crisis.
In 2016, with growing international attention to the plight of refugees, the United Nations General Assembly made a political declaration for refugees and migrants.
In an era of open and healthy discourse in global health, it is right that WHO’s role comes under regular scrutiny.
An intermittent stream of criticism comes from academia, and other sources, asserting that WHO is not doing what it has the potential to do to improve global health.
Generally, WHO is seen by commentators as having a choice to work in a number of ways: as a normative, standard-setting body orientated towards development; as a global activist and advocate for better health and action on the economic and social determinants of poor health; as an advisory body and provider of technical support and facilitation to its member states.
In reality, there is no choice between these approaches.
In advancing global health, WHO’s work must involve all of them.
In fulfilling its mandate for global health in a 21st Century context, WHO has an immensely difficult task.
At its heart is the immutable premise that the improvement of population health requires not only evidence-based technical interventions but also a swathe of other essential activities including political commitment and alignment, leadership, successful partnership working, multi-sector collaboration, and engagement with communities and citizenship.
This complexity is evident in so many areas where action or change is necessary.
It is evident when reflecting that the Ebola crisis had implications for many of the other United Nations specialist agencies, not just WHO.
It is evident in the need to dismantle obesogenic environments around the world that might have 20 or more nodal points of influence on a community’s patterns of calorie intake and physical activity.
WHO has started to develop a framework of priorities and guiding principles on the health of refugees and migrants, which the World Health Assembly in 2017 will consider further.
It is evident in the recognition that the task of eradicating poliovirus from the planet involves reaching children in conflict-affected areas where vaccinators may be targeted and murdered.
Frustrations with the slow pace of global health change has led to some major donors providing funding linked to the achievement of measurable improvements in health and disease outcomes.
Also, specialist agencies and partnerships have emerged (for example, UNAIDS; the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria; Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance) and some have received major allocations of funds in a similarly focused way.
This approach has achieved some success but it also raises fundamental questions about how best to achieve beneficial change in global health.
So-called vertical programmes usually achieve their results at the expense of broad-based horizontal actions to strengthen in-country health systems to be self-determining, self-sustaining and to deliver improved outcomes in that way.
Ministries of health in low-income countries are encouraged to chase the money and risk narrowing their thinking to circumscribed, packaged, programmes.
WHO’s funding model has changed over the last decade from one that was based largely on core-funding with discretion to determine, with Member States, how to deploy it.
Now, 80% of its entire budget is non-core and much earmarked for donor-determined priorities.
The popularity of vertical programmes is understandable.
They can and do achieve positive outcomes.
Two bleak events are without equal: the death of a baby, just months into a life that has barely begun; the death of a young woman, leaving a family without a mother.
In turn, the traditional development agenda of strengthening health systems has led, in the past, to the allocation of big sums of money by the larger donor nations without always yielding demonstrable benefits.
Taking an overview of how change has been achieved, and where there has been little progress, over the last decade, there are many other factors that need to be addressed that are not a specific element of the WHO’s role.
They include: • The limited extent of the essential multi-sectoral approach getting off the ground at country level • The poor quality of health data to monitor progress and evaluate change, especially in many low- and middle-income countries • The diffuse and unclear nature of many mechanisms of accountability for performance • The inability to consistently scale-up and spread best practice and innovation • The difficulty in moving to command and control processes in emergencies.
Not enough time in global health is spent in critical discussion of the right ways to achieve strategic change.
The striking improvement in the performance of the global polio eradication programme as a result of independently derived pointers to the need for systemic action is a small but important example of this.
With the valuable sources of constructive criticism and support of WHO’s role, the organisation’s own reform process has addressed three areas: priorities and programmes; governance; and, management.
It has made major changes in the way that it operates in each of these areas, including establishing: • Clearly defined priorities, with country offices allocating most of their budgets to priority areas • Effective managerial accountability, transparency and risk management • Strengthened engagement with stakeholders (particularly non-state actors) • Improved strategic decision-making • Increased capacity to respond to outbreaks and emergencies with health consequences • Better management of human resources • Information managed as a strategic asset.
The Framework for Engagement with Non-State Actors (FENSA) is an important development.
It was negotiated and adopted by Member States.
It acknowledges that WHO needs to work with a broad span of partners (NGOs, private sector entities, philanthropic foundations, and academic institutions) to be effective, and guides it clearly in doing so.
There is no starker reminder of inequity: that in some parts of the world, such events are rare to the point of being scandalous and newsworthy, whilst in others they are a common fact of life.
In particular, working with the private sector, under carefully defined conditions, has moved forward.
This is an area that WHO has shied away from in the past, with consequent lost opportunities.
The development of FENSA, which covers a wide spectrum of WHO’s work, builds on efforts over the last decade to unite diverse stakeholders.
Most notably, the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework – adopted by the World Health Assembly in 2011 – brings together public and private sectors for the crucial common goals of sharing viruses with human pandemic potential and improving poorer countries’ access to vaccines and other pandemicrelated supplies.
These reforms put WHO in a strong position to combine its traditional strengths of power of convening, and the expertise in formulating norms and standards, with its acknowledged position of overall leadership in global health.
A great deal has been achieved in the last decade, as this Report documents.
And important seeds have been planted that can and must bear fruit over the decades to come.
