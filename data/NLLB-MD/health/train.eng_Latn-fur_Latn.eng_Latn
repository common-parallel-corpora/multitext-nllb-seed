WHO reaffirmed that tuberculosis remains a top priority for the research and development of new antibiotics.
Disease eradication is an attractive proposition.
Once achieved, humanity is free of a pathogen for the rest of time.
To date, the list of eradicated human pathogens remains at only one: smallpox.
Polio and guinea-worm are now tantalisingly close.
WHO is a leader in both eradication efforts, alongside Member States and a formal set of partners that is slightly different for each.
Over the last decade, both polio and guinea-worm eradication efforts have advanced substantially.
But in both, the annual rate of disease decline has slowed very significantly since the early days.
As eradication nears, the challenges become greater.
By definition, the last places in which the pathogen remains are the places in which elimination is the most difficult.
Almost every country has shown increased life expectancy over the last decade.
So the slowing of progress is not a surprise, but the sheer scale of this effect was not fully anticipated.
Placing a definite bet would be foolhardy, but eradication now seems imminent for both polio and guinea-worm.
Both campaigns have major lessons to offer, whether or not the world decides to embark on further eradication goals.
In 2010, WHO published a Status Report on Noncommunicable Diseases.
This made it clear that: • Noncommunicable disease was the world’s leading health problem, causing nearly two-thirds of all deaths.
Most of the burden was due to cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes and chronic lung disease.
• This is not a rich countries’ problem alone: 80% of the burden of noncommunicable disease was falling in low- and middle-income countries.
• The prominent causes were four behavioural risk factors, which were symptoms of economic transition, rapid urbanisation, and modern lifestyles.
These were: tobacco use, unhealthy diet, insufficient physical activity and the harmful use of alcohol.
The report was action-oriented, spelling out a series of “best buys” for governments.
War has created the exception.
These are interventions that are effective, feasible, and affordable, even in resource-constrained settings.
Some are population-wide, such as smoke-free public places and reducing the salt content of food.
Some are healthcare interventions – such as using aspirin in the treatment of myocardial infarction, and providing simple inhaler treatments for asthma.
WHO Director-General, Dr Margaret Chan, said in the foreword of the 2010 report: “The warning remains stark.
The epidemic already extends far beyond the capacity of lower-income countries to cope.
In the absence of urgent action, the rising financial burden of these diseases will reach levels that are beyond the capacity of even the wealthiest countries in the world to manage.” In September 2011, the United Nations General Assembly held a High-Level Meeting on the Prevention and Control of Non-communicable Diseases, and issued a Political Declaration acknowledging that: “The global burden and threat of non-communicable diseases constitutes one of the major challenges for development in the twenty-first century, which undermines social and economic development throughout the world, and threatens the achievement of internationally agreed development goals.
We recognize that non-communicable diseases are a threat to the economies of many Member States, and may lead to increasing inequalities between countries and populations”.
Eight months later, in May 2012, the World Health Assembly established a bold goal, known as ’25 x 25’.
It aimed, by 2025, to reduce by 25% the number of premature deaths caused by the main four noncommunicable diseases - cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, and chronic respiratory disease.
A plan and monitoring framework followed: a Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable diseases 2013-2020.
In the Syrian Arab Republic, life expectancy has fallen by 9.3 years.
The plan provides guidance on reducing harmful alcohol use, physical inactivity, salt intake, tobacco use, and raised blood pressure.
It aims to halt the rise in diabetes and obesity; to increase the proportion of people receiving basic cardiovascular preventive care; and to boost the availability of basic technologies and medicines needed for treatment.
The plan builds on its predecessor report, providing Member States with clear “best buy” policy options for achieving each target.
Triennial status reports are planned, as are further High-Level meetings of the United Nations General Assembly.
In parallel with developing this overarching framework, there has been some strong – and some less strong – progress on a number of its key elements.
The WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control has been in place since 2005.
WHO uses MPOWER, a set of six cost-effective and high impact measures to help countries implement the Convention’s key demand reduction provisions.
Since 2007, the number of people protected by at least one MPOWER measure has tripled, but all countries can do more.
The prevalence of tobacco use has fallen a little, but one billion people still smoke – 80% of them in low- and middle-income countries.
Six million people die each year as a result.
There are two primary elements to life expectancy growth.
The 2013-2020 Global Action Plan includes a target of reducing tobacco use prevalence by 30%.
This is well off-track.
WHO is monitoring both MPOWER implementation and – where data and modelling allow – tobacco use prevalence.
The WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control is a pioneering approach in global health and some hope that it is a model that could be applied to other elements of noncommunicable disease.
WHO issued Global recommendations on physical activity for health in 2010, citing that one in four adults and four in five adolescents were not meeting the necessary standards.
The strength of physical inactivity as a risk factor has become more widely recognised during the last decade.
It is established in its own right, not just on the causal pathway to overweight and obesity.
WHO has shown high profile leadership on diet and health over the last decade.
The statement on sugar resounded very powerfully.
In March 2015, WHO strongly recommended that free sugars should account for less than 10% of people’s total energy intake, and that reducing to 5% would bring additional health benefit.
The first, particularly in the richer countries of the world, is that older people are getting even older – with the major social, economic and healthcare consequences that are well known and too often seen negatively.
This was underpinned by technical analysis that examined free sugar’s relationship to both weight gain and dental caries.
The guideline provided policy options for countries.
It particularly highlighted sugar-sweetened beverages, pointing to the research links to obesity.
The announcement of the guideline drew extensive media coverage, and prompted substantial engagement with the food and beverage industries at both international and national levels.
A year later, the WHO Commission on Ending Childhood Obesity released its report.
This included an explicit recommendation that Member States “implement an effective tax on sugar-sweetened beverages”.
The Commission on Ending Childhood Obesity was launched in 2014, at the Director-General’s initiative.
The alarming rise in childhood obesity prevalence provided a clear epidemiological rationale - and new evidence was emerging on the epigenetic basis of obesity, meriting close attention.
The Commissioners were a broad group.
Alongside senior public health practitioners were scientists, economists, a senior industry executive, a well-known athlete, and others.
The second element, particularly in the poorer countries of the world, is that life expectancy is growing because a much higher proportion of those born into this world are surviving childhood and living a full life.
The food and beverage industry engaged closely in the Commission’s work, with senior representatives meeting the Director-General on several occasions.
The Commission made its report to the World Health Assembly in 2016, and an implementation plan is due at the World Health Assembly in May 2017.
Its report made recommendations to Member States in six areas: • Promoting healthy food intake, and reducing the intake of unhealthy food and sugar-sweetened beverages • Promoting physical activity and reducing sedentary behaviour • Integrating measures to reduce the risk of childhood obesity into pre-conception and pregnancy care • Supporting diet and physical activity in early childhood • Promoting healthy school environments, physical activity, and health and nutrition literacy amongst school-age children and adolescents • Managing the weight of children and young people who are obese.
The Commission on Ending Childhood Obesity was also important because it showed the complexity of tackling obesity, the crucial role of multiple sectors, and the vital role of industry.
Each of these strands is a valuable part of the approach that will need to continue over the coming years, across the whole field of noncommunicable disease.
Other elements of noncommunicable disease have not been so prominently covered.
The burden of these diseases falls more heavily on those in lower socioeconomic groups.
Many of the risk factors are more common in these groups; the incidence and impact of many noncommunicable diseases is greater; and the costs of care can be catastrophic for the poor.
Some have argued that a goal to directly address the socioeconomic determinants should have been included in the 2013-20 Action Plan.
In 2013, the World Health Assembly endorsed a 2013- 2020 Mental Health Action Plan – the first such plan.
This too has major social and economic consequences, almost all very positive.
This focuses not only on tackling mental disorder, but on positively improving mental health.
It established a series of targets and recommended actions for Member States, and for bodies including WHO.
WHO has had a Mental Health Gap Action Programme in place since 2008, launched by the Director-General.
This works to improve the care for a people with a prioritised set of conditions (depression, dementia, psychoses, epilepsy, and others) in 90 countries, primarily in resource-poor settings.
WHO initiatives including the current Depression: Let’s Talk campaign, have brought important mental health issues to greater prominence.
On World Mental Health Day 2012, WHO partnered with writer and illustrator Matthew Johnstone, releasing a short video “I had a black dog, his name was depression”.
The aim was to raise awareness, and to encourage people with depression to take effective actions to help tame their own black dog.
The video has so far been viewed 7.5 million times on YouTube.
WHO has estimated that 4.4% of the world’s population is suffering from depression (more than 300 million people), 3.8% from anxiety, and that there are nearly 800,000 suicides every year.
Mental health makes an appearance in the targets of the Sustainable Development Goals.
Globally, the important expansion in life expectancy over the last decade has been driven by a number of changes, including: • The reduction in under-5 mortality rate of 32% between 2005 and 2015 • The fall in the maternal mortality ratio of 25% over the same period • The HIV mortality rate drop of 50% • The drop in the malaria mortality rate of 49% • The reduction in the age-specific risk of cardiovascular disease mortality of 14% • The reduction in the age-specific risk of cancer mortality of 11% • The 7% drop in the injury mortality rate.
It is to be hoped that, a decade from now, mental health will have moved more firmly into the spotlight.
Over the last five years, the important issue of dementia has come to greater prominence.
In May 2017, the World Health Assembly will review a Dementia Action Plan.
In 2013, the G8 held a special summit on dementia.
Speaking at that event, WHO Director-General Dr Margaret Chan said: “Dementia is a costly and heart-breaking epidemic with an immense impact, medically, psychologically, emotionally, and financially.
I can think of no other condition that has such a profound effect on loss of function, loss of independence, and the need for care.
I can think of no other condition that places such a heavy burden on society, families, communities, and economies.
I can think of no other condition where innovation, including breakthrough discoveries, is so badly needed.” Tackling noncommunicable disease is complex.
The complexity is increasingly being embraced, and this must continue and grow.
Tackling noncommunicable disease involves engaging far beyond the sphere of health and healthcare, to tackle the causes at their root.
The first four of these in particular were the areas of the three primary Millennium Development Goals related to health: to reduce child mortality, to improve maternal health, and to combat HIV, malaria, and other diseases.
It involves dealing with vested interests – working productively with industry if possible, and drawing red lines if not.
It involves being criticised as a Nanny – a hazard that communicable disease programmes do not have to bear.
It involves sustained political will.
And it requires building health systems that can deliver an increasingly sophisticated spectrum of prevention, treatment and care.
It is not easy – but it is central to the future of public health globally.
The Commission on Social Determinants of Health led by British-Australian epidemiologist, Sir Michael Marmot, presented its report to the Director-General of WHO in the summer of 2008.
In welcoming the report, Dr Chan said: “Health systems will not naturally gravitate towards equity” and called for “Unprecedented leadership to compel all actors, including those beyond the health sector to examine their impact on health.” WHO has had a longstanding commitment to health equity, but in presenting to the world the work of its Commission, Closing the Gap in a Generation: Health Equity through Action on the Social Determinants of Health, it fired the starting gun on a deeper and more fundamental approach linking equity, social justice, poverty and health, driven by some of the compelling inequalities spelled out in the report at the time of its launch: • Life expectancy for Indigenous Australian males shorter by 17 years than all other Australian males • Maternal mortality 3–4 times higher among the poor than among the rich in Indonesia • Child mortality in the slums of Nairobi is 2.5 times higher than in other parts of the city • A baby born to a Bolivian mother with no education had a greater than 10% chance of dying in the first year, while one born to a woman with at least secondary education had less than a 0.4% chance • In Uganda, the death rate of children under 5 years in the richest fifth of households was 106 per 1000 live births but in the poorest fifth of households in Uganda it was even worse – 192 deaths per 1000 live births (that was nearly a fifth of all babies born alive to the poorest households destined to die before they reach their fifth birthday).
Despite the stark statistical picture that the Commission revealed, its report was not all bad news.
There were many examples where targeted action, local and country innovation, and committed leadership were making a difference.
The examples highlighted in the report included: a comprehensive approach to early childhood development in poor Jamaican communities; the establishment of universal child development services in Cuba; and, the expansion of pre-primary education for socially disadvantaged children in Chile.
Since the beginning of the 21st Century, the march of globalization has quickened, the world has suffered a major financial crisis, whilst serious armed conflicts and deteriorating security situations in some parts of the world have led to displacements and migration of populations on a massive scale.
The question is often asked: what truly lies behind these major gains? Socioeconomic development has played a part.
The Commission on Social Determinants of Health set out three guiding principles through which to organize programmes of action to address the challenges and needs that it identified: • Improve the conditions of daily life – the circumstances in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age • Tackle the inequitable distribution of power, money, and resources – the structural drivers of those conditions of daily life – globally, nationally, and locally • Measure the problem, evaluate action, expand the knowledge base, develop a workforce that is trained in the social determinants of health, and raise public awareness about the social determinants of health.
WHO had previously taken high-level strategic positions on the fundamental causes of poor health.
For example, Director-General Brundtland in the 1999 World Health Report estimated that around half the mortality reduction in the 30 years since 1960 in low-income and middle-income countries had been due to two main underlying influences: income and education.
Nevertheless, much of the emphasis on solutions in the report was on strengthening health systems rather than broader-based initiatives in other sectors.
In 2001, the Commission on Macroeconomics and Health, led by Professor Jeffrey Sachs, focused on the potential benefits to health of investment in areas such as education, sanitation, and water, and explored the relevance of poverty and the gains to health through tackling it.
The Commission on Social Determinants of Health has been one of the most important policy initiatives that WHO has launched in the last decade.
It has cascaded through the regional and country networks, not just as a technical reminder of the importance of health equity but as a transformative approach to thinking about the meaning of “health” itself, and how, in practical terms, to really address the root causes of poor health and social and economic disadvantage.
Traditionally, although the global health community has recognized the wider and deeper influences on health in a diagnostic sense, action has tended to concentrate on the established risk factors (e.g.
smoking, physical inactivity, obesity, high blood pressure, unhealthy nutrition, excess alcohol intake).
Social determinants have not been viewed as modifiable in the same way that these established risk factors are.
Changes that go along with this have included improved female (and male) education, and falling fertility rates.
However, the case studies in the Commission’s report, and the way in which many of WHO’s regions as well as national governments have constructed their own Marmot-style reviews and plans, has created a sense that practical action is not just feasible, not just necessary, but almost a moral imperative.
In 2011, the Brazil government and WHO convened an important meeting of Heads of Government, Ministers and government representatives, which issued the Rio Political Declaration on Social Determinants of Health.
This included the clause: “We reaffirm that health inequities within and between countries are politically, socially and economically unacceptable, as well as unfair and largely avoidable, and that the promotion of health equity is essential to sustainable development and to a better quality of life and well-being for all, which in turn can contribute to peace and security”.
It is of particular importance that the orientation of the meeting was “political”.
This is where the commitment, ideas, and will needs to come from if the “causes of the causes” of ill health, premature mortality, and disability are to be really acted upon.
The fact that health is often determined in other sectors has become a recurrent topic in global policy fora.
It was clearly understood and expressed by the Heads of Government at this meeting.
The Rio Political Declaration established five action areas, to: 1.
adopt better governance for health and development 2.
promote participation in policy-making and implementation 3.
Effective health interventions delivered successfully on a greater scale (particularly anti-retroviral drugs, insecticide-impregnated bed nets, measles vaccines) have also made an impact.
further reorient the health sector towards reducing health inequities 4.
strengthen global governance and collaboration 5.
monitor progress and increase accountability Continuing to have a laser focus on the social determinants of health is one of the most important roles of WHO in the future.
This is not simply to ensure that the many inequities in health are matched with practical programmes of action but to act as a custodian of a philosophy of public health that is broad-based, inter-disciplinary, and multi-sectoral.
The last decade has brought a broadening awareness of the social determinants of health, and the programs of action needed to address them.
This will be critical in the era of sustainable development.
The Sustainable Development Goals’ promise of “leaving no-one behind” means that health is protected and promoted to fulfil potential in life, but also that targeting adverse social circumstances will enable attainment of the best possible health.
The numerical challenges of population ageing are formidable.
In 40 years’ time, 80% of the world’s over-60s will be in low- and middle-income countries.
They will number more than the entire population of high-income countries combined.
The balance between the impact of general development and the impact of specific interventions in the field of health can be debated, but ultimately both have been important.
In the same time frame, there will be 330 million people over 60 years in China and 200 million in India, and a quarter of the population of Latin America and the Caribbean will also be in this age group.
With the rise in life expectancy, attention in many parts of the world is increasingly being focused on the question of healthy life expectancy.
This varies greatly between and within countries.
It is often assumed that because death rates are falling, levels of disease and disability are coming down too.
Some have asserted that this is not the case, saying that those countries that have experienced gains in life expectancy will find that the extra years are marked by ill-health and disability.
The reality is that no one really knows for certain, though figures are regularly quoted.
Routinely available information on healthy life expectancy is scarce and very inadequate.
Discussing the quality of information may seem a technical argument.
It is not.
It will not be possible to plan properly for the impact of population ageing, nor evaluate public health programmes aimed at healthy ageing, without comprehensive valid measurement of health and functioning in older populations.
As childhood mortality has fallen, so the global health spotlight has fallen on the causes of premature death that come later in life.
There is also disagreement amongst experts on the choice of methods.
For example, measures based on the presence, or absence, of disease do not take account of the fact that some older people experience much more disability from them than others.
Also, the presence of multi-morbidity complicates the construction of metrics.
Simple measures of functioning in which older people are asked about or assessed for their ability to carry out activities of daily living, are easily understood.
However, it can be difficult to determine whether the deficit is the individual or the environmental circumstances.
For instance, someone might declare that they have difficulty in shopping for food because their walking is impaired or because there are no neighbourhood shops, so that the problem is access rather than loss of capacity.
To address these uncertainties in characterizing health in older age, WHO has adopted the concept of functional ability: “The health-related attributes that enable people to be and to do what they have reason to value; it is made up of the intrinsic capacity of the individual, relevant environmental characteristics and the interactions between the individual and these characteristics.” As people, and populations, age, the proportion of years spent in a state of health and vitality is of major significance.
It has implications for quality of life of the individual, the level of social support required, and for families.
Most importantly, it has a great relevance to the need and demand for healthcare.
Many discussions about the future of healthcare start gloomily with a consideration of the growing numbers of old and very old people, with multiple chronic diseases, who are spoken of as a burden.
Over the last decade, progress has been made in preventing and treating noncommunicable disease.
This is misleading.
The facts do not bear out assumptions that older people are largely dependent and unproductive.
On a world view, and also within countries and regions, this population is hugely diverse in its state of health, its outlook and attitudes, as well as its relationship with work, family life and civil society more generally.
Older people become involved in the societies that they live in through a wide range of forms of participation, including as: mentors, caregivers, artists, consumers, innovators, entrepreneurs and members of the workforce.
These roles can themselves promote older people’s health and well-being.
Low- and middle-income countries have become used to being characterized by their youthful populations, but these are the very groups who will be ageing.
If present levels of resources and disease patterns persist, higher levels of poverty will make ageing in low- and middle-income countries more complex.
So too will: weak health systems; the greater threat of serious communicable and parasitic diseases; vulnerability to natural disasters; extreme weather events; and regional conflicts that displace populations.
Older people will be at additional jeopardy because of these influences.
The policy response to these challenges has developed slowly over the past decade as heads of state and health ministers have realized that the rapid population ageing that their countries are experiencing will have a major impact on all aspects of their societies.
This has contributed to the improvements in life expectancy.
In 2015, the Director-General of WHO contributed to a publication (Facing the facts: the truth about ageing and development) by the NGO Help Age International, along with Mary Robinson (one of The Elders) and other leaders and experts.
At the time of the report’s launch, the Director-General said: “The health needs of the world’s population are being transformed by global ageing yet governments, development and health practitioners have been slow to react.
The increase in the number of older people is one of the success stories of international development and how we respond to this reality will be one of the keys to prosperity in the future.” WHO produced a landmark document in 2015, the World Report on Ageing and Health.
The report set out a vision for healthy ageing, defined as: “the process of developing and maintaining the functional ability that enables well-being in older age”.
The World Report on Ageing and Health expressed key priorities: • aligning health systems with the needs of the older populations they now serve • developing systems for providing long-term care • creating age-friendly environments • improving measurement, monitoring and understanding.
These priorities were picked up again in another important action when the World Health Assembly in 2016 was asked to adopt The Global Strategy and Action Plan on Ageing and Health.
This aimed to gain Member States’ commitment and political leadership to take practical steps and engage multi-sector partners to implement the goal and priorities of the earlier World Report.
The World Report and the Global Strategy and Action Plan set an ambitious but exciting agenda to create a decade of healthy ageing in which the growth in life expectancy is treated as an opportunity and not a threat: “If people are experiencing these extra years in good health and live in a supportive environment, their ability to do the things they value will have few limits.” Since its foundation in the second half of the 20th century, through to the turn of the Millennium, WHO’s commitment to health services was based on a development approach that aligned with donor governments’ and foundations’ drive to strengthen health systems.
There was also particular emphasis on primary care, notably with the touchstone Alma Ata Declaration of 1978, that saw the advancement of primary care as the most important route to achieving the goals of Health for All.
The goal of strengthening health systems is still an important one, but has not always been clear and specific enough to guide action and investment.
This is often misunderstood, because noncommunicable disease is also causing more illness and death than it was a decade ago.
Some speak of it in more critical terms as a development “mantra” that has led to untargeted donor aid with few demonstrable gains.
Whilst this is unfair, there is no doubt that the introduction of the more focused, citizen-oriented, and rights-based goal of Universal Health Coverage (defined as “people having access to the health care they need without suffering financial hardship”) has elevated concern about the inadequacy of health systems to a much higher level of prominence.
Universal health coverage as an overarching goal Speaking at the Ministerial meeting on Universal Health Coverage in Singapore in February 2015, WHO Director-General Dr Margaret Chan said: “Universal health coverage is one of the most powerful social equalizers among all policy options.
It is the ultimate expression of fairness.
If public health has something that can help our troubled, out-of-balance world, it is this: growing evidence that well-functioning and inclusive health systems contribute to social cohesion, equity, and stability”.
Particularly over the last five years, WHO has worked with other global bodies, heads of state, and health ministers to put the achievement of Universal Health Coverage high on everyone’s agenda.
The United Nations General Assembly has called upon Member States to “urgently and significantly scale-up efforts to accelerate the transition towards universal access to affordable and quality healthcare services.” The World Bank has set out three key aims of Universal Health Coverage: • To achieve better health and development outcomes • To help prevent people from falling into poverty due to illness • To give people the opportunity to lead healthier, more productive lives.
The inclusion of a target in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) framework is of vital importance.
SDG 3, target 8 is: “To achieve universal health coverage, including financial risk protection, access to quality essential health care services, and access to safe, effective, quality, and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all.” WHO’s leadership has also engaged other key constituencies and stakeholders, importantly civil society.
For example, after widespread consultation with its members, the International Association of Patient Organisations (IAPO) has developed a set of principles governing universal access to health coverage based on: • Accessibility • Patient-centredness and equity • Choice and empowerment • Quality • Partnership and collaboration • Sustainability and value • Accountability and transparency.
These statements are not contradictory: at any given age, the mortality associated with noncommunicable disease is decreasing, hence the positive contribution to life expectancy.
Achieving universal health coverage has multiple dimensions.
WHO has done strong work on many fronts – most notably in the areas of financing, governance and alignment.
It is clear from the discussions on Universal Health Coverage that the offer of health services to populations around the world should not just be of any health services, but those based on strong foundations of safety and good quality.
This is an area in which WHO has done much ground-breaking work over the last decade.
WHO’s focus on the quality of health services started with a comprehensive global programme in patient safety, spearheaded by two global patient safety challenges.
The first Global Patient Safety Challenge was aimed at engaging the world to reduce the level of healthcare infection.
The aim of the Challenge was highly visible and easily understood by politicians, health professionals and civil society.
It was relevant to all countries: rich, poor, and emerging economies.
Everyone had a vested interest in its success because anyone could need treatment in a health facility and could therefore become the victim of harm by acquiring an infection.
In driving forward Clean Care is Safer Care, a wide range of supporting activities and campaigns was implemented.
But this is outweighed by the increasing numbers of people in the higher age bands, creating a greater overall burden in the population.
The idea of this Challenge generated huge interest and enthusiasm across all six WHO regions.
As ministers signed pledges of commitment to the Challenge in country and regional launches and events, from a small start, the commitments grew to cover more than 85% of the world’s population.
The WHO hand hygiene global campaign (SAVE LIVES: Clean Your Hands), launched in 2009, has been particularly successful.
Before the Challenge, alcohol-based hand rubs (hand sanitizers) were not commonplace in hospitals around the world.
The core message was that the lack of consistent, immediate, access to a sink equipped with soap and single-use towels (high-income countries) and/ or the unavailability of clean water (many low-income countries) put patients at risk.
The evidence of higher efficacy, effectiveness, and skin tolerability of alcohol-based hand rubs made them the method of choice to assure hand hygiene.
WHO made alcohol-based hand rubs more affordable to the poorest hospitals of the world by ensuring that the University Hospital of Geneva formulation became available with no patent restriction for local manufacture.
Overall, the first Challenge represented a proven change model that mobilised the world around infection prevention through: a) raising awareness about the burden of the problem to engage stakeholders; b) an approach to engage nations through demonstrable commitment; and, c) the availability of evidence-based guidance and implementation tools to drive improvement.
A second Global Patient Safety Challenge recognised the relatively high burden of disease arising from unsafe surgical care.
Safe Surgery Saves Lives created a surgical checklist that was piloted, evaluated and promoted for use globally.
Public health workers have been targeted and killed when carrying out their humanitarian work.
Noncommunicable disease is also becoming more important in relative terms; the gains made against it have been less impressive than those made against communicable disease.
Early studies of its use showed that the checklist reduced morbidity and mortality associated with surgery.
Major professional bodies across the world endorsed it.
It is in widespread use in hospitals in many countries and, increasingly, it is seen as essential if the key risks of surgery are to be avoided.
The checklist concept was developed further with the creation of the WHO Safe Childbirth Checklist, which focuses on reducing risk and adverse outcomes related to childbirth for both mothers and babies.
The Checklist supports the delivery of essential maternal and perinatal care practices and addresses the major causes of maternal death, intra-partum related stillbirths, and neonatal deaths.
The Safe Childbirth Checklist Collaboration has already made significant strides to improving maternal and neonatal health.
It is hoped that the Checklist can become an effective life-saving tool that can be used in a wide-range of settings.
These programmes – the two Global Challenges, the research and knowledge management programme, and the Patients for Patient Safety initiative – have all had a global reach.
The WHO Patient Safety Programme has raised awareness across the world of the key concepts and strategies in patient safety.
It has inspired passion for the universal cause of making health care safer.
The United Nations Millennium Development Goal era has ended.
It has secured commitment at the highest level amongst health ministers and health leaders in Member States of the World Health Organization.
It has provided standards, evidence-based guidance and practical tools to support those involved in the design of patient safety programmes within nations’ health care systems.
It has championed the use of the stories of patients and families who have been the victims of unsafe care.
All of these approaches are fundamentally important in the drive to strengthen all elements of quality health service delivery - with safety being central to this, but not the whole story.
To further shape the nature of Universal Health Coverage, and how it is delivered, WHO developed a Framework on Integrated, People-Centred Health Services.
This sought to promote a fundamental shift in the funding, management and delivery of health services.
It also aimed to provide a blueprint to address two common adverse features of many healthcare systems: that they are poorly coordinated and fragmented.
The framework eschews purely disease-based models of care, instead advocating putting people and communities at the centre of health systems.
Development of the Framework drew on evidence demonstrating that health systems designed around people’s and communities’ needs are more effective, cost less, improve health literacy and patient engagement, and are more resilient to health crises.
Giving a clear priority to Universal Health Coverage has also meant that there is an imperative to measure and monitor progress, as well as to stimulate interest in the academic world to consider the effectiveness of new models of care and to evaluate progress.
The Sustainable Development Goals are what matters now.
The opportunity to prevent a vast swathe of human disease over a lifetime is the greatest development in the history of public health.
Lifelong protection, by immunization in childhood, is too often taken for granted.
The aim of the Global Vaccine Action Plan, launched by the World Health Assembly in 2012, was to create: “A world in which all individuals and communities enjoy lives free from vaccine-preventable disease”.
Vaccines were already saving 2.5 million lives – mainly of children – every year.
Yet, 1.5 million were dying from diseases that vaccination can prevent.
The action plan sounded a clarion call: “Overwhelming evidence demonstrates the benefits of immunization as one of the most successful and cost-effective health interventions known.
Over the past several decades, immunization has achieved many things, including the eradication of smallpox, an accomplishment that has been called one of humanity’s greatest triumphs.
Vaccines have saved countless lives, lowered the global incidence of polio by 99 percent and reduced illness, disability and death.” The World Health Organization had launched its Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) in 1974.
At that time, great progress was being made towards eradicating smallpox – the first time (and, so far, the only time) that a human pathogen was wiped from the planet.
This momentous feat demonstrated the immense power of vaccines, and created enthusiasm to spread the benefit more widely.
Good Health and Wellbeing is the third Sustainable Development Goal.
When the Expanded Programme on Immunization was launched, just one in 20 of the world’s children received the basic set of vaccines: protection against polio, diphtheria, tuberculosis, pertussis, measles, and tetanus.
By 2010, that earlier paltry figure of 5% coverage had grown to 85%.
In the first decade of the new Millennium, a new focus and determination came into play.
Gavi, the vaccine alliance, was founded in 2000.
WHO then led the creation of the first Global Immunization Vision and Strategy, intended to cover the period 2006 to 2015.
This established a global framework for regions and countries.
But more was needed.
In January 2010, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Bill Gates, Co-Chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, announced that: “We must make this the decade of vaccines.
Vaccines already save and improve millions of lives in developing countries.
Innovation will make it possible to save more children than ever before”.
Its 13 targets demand progress on maternal, childhood and communicable disease, as well as to: reduce premature mortality from non-communicable diseases by one third; halve the number of global deaths and injuries from road traffic accidents; reduce the number of deaths and illnesses from hazardous chemicals, as well as air, water and soil pollution and contamination; achieve universal health coverage; promote mental health and well-being; strengthen the prevention and treatment of substance abuse; and achieve universal access to sexual and reproductive healthcare services.
The coalescence of action necessary to deliver this transformation started to happen.
In 2011, the World Health Assembly discussed and agreed on its strategic direction.
A substantial but rapid consultation received input from more than 1000 people in 140 countries.
And so, in 2012, the Global Vaccine Action Plan was launched.
The Global Vaccine Action Plan set out a number of key challenges: • Achieving global polio eradication – the last ever case of wild polio to occur no later than 2014 • Regional tetanus, measles and rubella elimination – there were no new targets, but reiteration of those already endorsed by the regional and global bodies • Improving vaccine coverage – goals at national level and the aim of enhancing the equity of coverage within countries • Introducing new vaccines – targets to expand use of existing vaccines to countries where they were not used • Research and development – making at least one new disease vaccine-preventable.
The Plan also pledged to help achieve the fourth Millennium Development Goal – reducing under-5 mortality – towards which vaccines were already making a substantial contribution.
Since the Plan’s launch, great progress has been made to introduce new and under-utilised vaccines.
Scaling up of pneumococcal and rotavirus vaccines was particularly promising, preventing the leading causes of under-5 deaths from pneumonia and diarrhoea respectively.
Between 2000 and 2015, $10 billion was committed to Gavi – an alliance of which WHO is a key member.
Three-quarters of the money was to fund vaccine introductions directly.
